EDWIN, THE YOUNG RABBIT FANCIER.


Edwin was a very tender-hearted boy, and very eager about a thing when
he took it into his head; but his enthusiasm very often left him just
at the time it ought to have remained with him. Thus he never pursued
any study or amusement for any length of time with profit to himself,
and often fell into very grievous errors.

“Oh! dear mama,” said he one day to his mother. “I do so much wish that
I had something for a pet; there is Charles Jones has a sweet little
bird, and cousin James has a squirrel. I should so like something for a
pet. Do, mama, buy me something—a Guinea pig, or a couple of pigeons,
or a rabbit. Oh! I saw such a beautiful white rabbit yesterday.

“Ay, my dear,” said his mama, “I am afraid you would soon grow tired of
your rabbit, as you did of your gun, and bow and arrow, and ship, and
rocking-horse.”

“Oh! but a rabbit is quite different, mama; you can love a rabbit,
you know, and coax it, and feed it, and make it happy. I should go
out early in the morning, and pick some nice clover for it, and some
thistle, and dandelion, and marsh mallows. I know how to feed rabbits—I
have learned all about it. I must not give them too much green stuff,
but some nice bran and oats; and then I could make a little trough for
it to eat from, you know; and—and—”

“I am sure, my dear, it would be too much trouble to you; rabbits
require a great deal of care and attention, and you so soon get tired
of any thing you take up, that I fear it would soon suffer from
neglect.”

“I am sure I should never _neglect_ it, mama; and if you will give me a
shilling, I can buy a beauty—a real white French rabbit, with red eyes,
and a coat like swansdown. Do, mama, give me a shilling.”

“No, my dear,” said she, “I really must refuse you.”

Now, although Edwin was a little boy, he said to himself, “I know it is
only because mama wished to save her money; ’tis not because she really
thinks I shall neglect the rabbit, but because she does not like to
part with her money.” He thought himself very cunning? did he not?

So Edwin began to pout and whine, and to tease his mama, being
determined to let her have no peace. “You know, mama,” said he, “I
shall be so fond of it; I will make it a house, and then I could cut
down some grass, and dry it, and make hay for it to lie upon; and I
could sow some oats for it in my garden; I should not want any thing
else to amuse me all the year round.”

Whether to humor Edwin or to teach him a lesson, I will not say,
but his mama gave him a shilling, and off he ran, and purchased the
milk-white, red-eyed rabbit he had so longed for.

Joyful enough was he when he brought it home; he paraded it round the
house, showed it to every member of the family, housemaid, laundrymaid,
footman, and cook, and every body praised the rabbit, as the most
beautiful creature they had ever seen.

The next morning Edwin rose by times, and began to look for wood to
build his rabbit house. He procured saw, nails, and hammer; and at last
found some old planks, and began to saw them, and cut them, and chisel
and plane, till his little arms ached again.

He had soon cut two or three pieces of board up, but to no purpose; one
was too short, another too long, a third had a knot in it, and a fourth
was spoiled in splitting. Vexed with his want of success, Edwin said,
“I shall not make him a house to-night—he must be contented with being
fastened in the coal-hole to-night, where he will have room plenty.”

So bunny was put into the coal-hole, with a handful of cabbage-leaves,
and told to make himself happy till morning, and as it happened to be
election night, Edward went to amuse himself by making bonfires.

In the morning Edwin went to the coal-hole to look after bunny. There
it was sure enough, but, instead of its being a beautiful white
rabbit—by hopping about among the coals—it had become almost as black
as the coals themselves.

“Well, I never!” said the little boy—“what a dirty little thing it is”,
and so he tried to catch it; but bunny not liking to be caught, led the
youngster a fine dance in the coal-hole, and at last he fell over a
large lump of coal, and dirtied his clean frill and white pinafore.

It was difficult to say which was the dirtiest of the two, Edwin or the
rabbit. The little boy, however, being quite out of patience, made no
further effort, but shut the coal-hole door, and in great terror ran to
the nursery-maid to put him into cleaner trim. He did not go again into
the place where the rabbit was that day, and so the poor thing was kept
without food, for Edward totally forgot that he had not fed his pet.

However, the next day he again repaired to the place, and having caught
bunny, took it into the stable-yard, and put it into an unoccupied
pig-sty. The first intention of making a house was quite given up, and
Edwin began to think his rabbit was a great plague; he, however, gave
it some more cabbage leaves, and left it.

[Illustration: Edwin with black rabbit]

The fact was, Edwin was getting tired of his rabbit; he, however,
bought it a few oats, and gave it a little hay. He went out for a few
mornings and gathered a little clover, but in less than a week this
was thought to be a great deal of trouble; besides which, the rabbit
seemed lame, and did not look so pretty as it did at first.

At last Edwin quite forgot his rabbit for two days, and when he went
to look at it he was quite surprised to find it lying on its side. He
called, bunny, bunny. The poor thing looked at him, and seemed pleased
to see him, for its long ears moved as if it was.

Edwin took it up; it seemed to have lost the use of its hind legs; it
squeaked when it was touched; and so the little boy laid it down again.
He felt it all over—it was very thin, and seemed half starved.

Edwin now ran and got a saucer full of oats, and placed it beside the
poor thing; he also ran to the next field, and plucked some nice sow
thistle, and gave it to eat. Bunny looked grateful, and tried to eat,
but could not.

Edwin, in placing his hand down by its side, felt the beatings of its
heart; it went beat, beat, beat—throb, throb, throb, quicker than a
watch; and every now and then its head twitched, and the skin of its
jaw drew up, as if it were in great pain.

And yet the poor animal seemed glad to have some one by its side, and
rubbed its nose against Edwin’s hand; and then it panted again, and its
eyes grew dim; it was dying; Edwin now began to cry.

“Oh! my poor dear, dear, dear, bunny,” said he, “what shall I do to
make you well?—oh! what would I give? Oh! I have killed you, for I know
I have. Oh! my poor, dear bunny—let me kiss you, dear bunny”—Here the
little fellow stooped down to kiss the rabbit. Just at that moment it
gave a struggle—in the next it was dead.

Edwin’s eyes were full of tears, and when he could see through them,
and found out what had happened, he broke out into loud sobs and cries,
till he roused the whole house. “Oh! my dear rabbit—oh! I have killed
my rabbit—oh! what shall I do?” he uttered, in deepest grief.

“Ay,” said his mama, who was called to the spot by his outcries, “I
feared it would be thus:—who would think a house-bred rabbit could live
in a damp pig-sty? The poor thing has been destroyed by neglect.”

“Oh, yes, dear mama, do not scold me; I know I have been very naughty.
Oh, I do love my dear rabbit; I love it more now it is dead than I
did when it was alive; but is it really dead, mama! no, is it? it is
quite warm, and may get well again,—say it will, there’s a dear, dear
mother,” and then he cried again.

The rabbit was, however, dead; and had caught its death in the way
Edwin’s mama supposed, by being ill fed and kept in a damp place, by
thoughtless, if not cruel, _neglect_.

Edwin was overcome with grief,—but it was now too late, sad was that
night to him, for something told him that he had been cruel to that
he had promised to love. He got no sleep; and early in the morning he
arose, and went to the place where his pet was laid.

He wept all the next day; and, in the evening, he dug a grave in his
own little garden, close by the side of a young rose tree. Then he
wrapped the body in some nice hay, and laid it in its narrow cell, and
placed rose leaves upon it, and covered it gently with the earth; and
his heart was like to burst when he heaped the mound upon it,—and he
was forced to pause in his task by the full gushing of his tears.

“My child,” said his mama, who watched him at his sorrowful task, “if
you had taken half the trouble for bunny, when alive, as you do now he
is dead, he would have been alive now.”

“Yes, yes, dear mama,—I know—I know; but do tell me, pray do—will not
rabbits go to heaven? Is there not some place where they can be happy?
I hope my poor bunny may!” and here the little fellow sobbed again.

“Give me a kiss, my dear boy,” said his mama; come leave this spot: and
so she gently led him away from the rabbit’s grave.

JULIA MARTIN.

In many of the little coves and bays on the coast of Cornwall, small
villages may be found—the dwellings of fishermen, their wives, and
families. Here, perhaps, they have lived from the time they were
born, without a thought or a wish, as far as the land is concerned,
beyond the narrow place in which they dwell. The sea is the great
object of their cares, for it contains the means by which they live. By
the fish which they catch in it, they are provided with meat, drink,
and lodging: and too often is the sea their grave. The poor men lead a
hard and anxious life in their fishing pursuits; and are often tempted
to risk their lives, rather than give up a chance, when a favorable
shoal of fish may be expected. The women mostly spend their time in
making and mending nets, and drying and salting the fish. Even the
children may be always found employed about fish in some way or other.
The very young make playthings of the bones; those about ten or eleven
assist their mothers in curing fish; and all, both old and young, feed,
with a relish never lost, on the finny tribe. It is a pretty sight,
on a fine sunny day, to see the seine, or net, drawn in on the white
pebbly beach: it contains, perhaps, many hundreds of fishes, tinted
with all the colors of the rainbow. The various families to whom the
net belongs crowd down to the shore for their share of the fish; for,
as the net costs a great deal of money, the price is divided, perhaps,
between half a dozen owners. During the winter season, should there
have been any failure in the fishing, great hardships are sometimes
felt by these poor people. The stock of salt fish is done; potatoes
are dear, and money to buy bread is but scarce. The patience and
self-denial shown under such privations is truly to be admired, and
might furnish a useful lesson to those whom it had pleased God to
provide, at all seasons, with every thing that can make life pleasant;
and who are too apt to complain if some of the lesser means of their
enjoyment are cut off by a hard winter season.

[Illustration: THE FISHERMEN.]

Rosecreay, one of the fishing villages we have been describing, was
fortunate, during a very severe winter, in having near it a very
charitable lady, who had taken a house which for many years had been
without an inmate.

Why she remained in a cold and bleak spot, so far from London, from
whence she came, her friends often wondered; and her daughter Julia,
when she heard the wind coming in great gusts up the valley, or the
rain beating against the windows, as if it insisted on coming in, would
wish she was back again in the pretty house at Kensington. Mrs. Martin
was not poor, but she was not rich, and she had taken the old house for
three years, because the rent was very low; her own house in town she
had let, and the change was made that her only son, Frederic, might
study as a painter. How many mothers thus deny themselves comforts,
that they may save money for those dearer to them than their own lives!
How few meet with any reward for their self-denial! Mrs. Martin was
constant in her visits to the families of the fishermen; gave them
tracts to read; made clothes for the poor children; and was always
ready, in time of illness, with medicine for the sick, and soup for
those getting better. She also tried to teach them cleaner habits; but
in this she failed. Julia soon got tired of going with her mother to
see people who persisted in having such bad smells in and about their
houses, wondering, at the same time, that, with water so near, the
village was not kept cleaner; to which an old woman would sometimes
reply, that fish never smell ill to them. One stormy day in January,
Mrs. Martin and Julia sat at the window watching the huge waves that
came tumbling in, with, as Julia said, “great white caps on their
heads.” The fine weather of yesterday, said Mrs. Martin, I hear, has
tempted poor John Penman to go out fishing, in spite of his having
hardly got rid of the fever he has so long had. I am afraid that as
he knew that Frederic is coming we should like some fish to-day. The
weather changed so suddenly in the night, that I feel quite anxious
lest he should have been lost. Mrs. Martin’s fears were too well
founded, for John Penman, his eldest son, and another lad, never saw
their homes again: the boat had been lost during the heavy gale, and
all on board had perished.

How dreadful! said Julia. I wish we did not live where we were always
hearing and seeing such disagreeable things. We must not, my dear
Julia, said her mother, indulge in such selfish feelings; let us rather
think what we can do for the poor widow and her orphans, whether it is
disagreeable or not. The next morning, though it was still stormy, Mrs.
Martin set out for the cottage of Mrs. Penman; and as Julia thought it
was too cold to venture out, she was spared the sad scene that was seen
by Mrs. Martin. The children were crying round the bed of their poor
mother, where she lay in too much grief to attend to the kindness of
the neighbors, who crowded round trying to comfort her.

The room was small and dirty, with but little furniture in it; but
strange to say, on one side of it hung an old circular painting, and
though it was nearly black with smoke, Mrs. Martin could see it was no
common picture. With the hope that it might prove of some use to the
poor woman, she got the eldest boy to carry it to her house, sending
back by him a basket laden with food for his desolate home. Frederic
had arrived in due time the night before, and his mother now begged
him to look at the old painting. Although he had not long been an
artist, he at once saw that it had been painted by a skilful hand.
While cleaning it from the smoke and dirt, they found the name of the
painter and of the lady on the canvas. On inquiry, they also found
that John Penman’s father had saved the picture from a great house,
which had been burnt to the ground many years ago. Mrs. Martin wrote
to the family to whom the painting had once belonged, and they were
glad to pay the poor woman, to her great surprise and joy, a handsome
sum of money for it. She was then able to buy a share in a net, which
her husband had always been too poor to do, and by it was enabled to
bring up her family in the humble way to which they had always been
accustomed.

Ah! mother, said Julia, what good you have been able to do from always
thinking of other people rather than yourself. I will never grumble
again at the smells of the fishing village, but try, if I can, to be
as useful there as you have been; and Julia, in spite of the cold and
bleak winter, well kept her promise.

THE HAYMAKERS.]


THE HAYMAKERS.

The haymakers are working blithely, tossing about the grass, and
talking and laughing right merrily. This is a holiday, both for old
and young. Many who are employed in manufactures, with their wives and
children, obtain leave to work in the fields when hands are scarce;
and doing so seems like a new life to them. You may see at the further
end, hillocks of grass thrown up in long rows; the haymakers call them
wind-cocks; they are piled light and high, that the wind may blow
through them; but in this part of the field people are tossing the
hay about. Gray-headed old men are here, aged women, and children,
seemingly without number. Their parents are hard at work and very glad
are they to put the “wee things” in safe keeping among the old folks,
who yet can help a little. Look at those girls and boys at play—see
how they pelt one another with the hay, and roll each other over upon
the grass—these are happy days. See those youngsters, scarcely able
to totter, how they tumble on the sweet, fresh grass; while those who
have strength to handle the rake mimic the labors of their parents,
and draw tiny loads along the greensward. Meanwhile the hay is thrown
about, and with each returning day comes the same pleasant labor, till
the creaking of a wagon, lumbering up the hollow-road from the old
farm-house, half way down the hill, gives the signal, which tells that
the haymaking season is about to close. A short time elapses, and the
creak of the heavy laden wagon is heard ringing over the stones. It
comes up again for another load, then lumbers back to the old farm,
where laborers are busily employed in placing the hay upon a strong
foundation of wattled boughs. Some tread down the hay; others throw it
up from out the wagon; till at length loud huzzas, that wake up all the
neighboring echoes, announce that all the hay-stacks are completed.




THE REAPERS.


The village seems deserted. No children on the green running races with
each other, or playing hunt-the-slipper on the smooth turf. No old men
resting beneath the manorial tree, sunning themselves, and talking
with feeble voices, like the aged men of Troy, compared by Homer to
grasshoppers; neither is there the sound of the spinning-wheel by the
open cottage door, with its rustic porch and clustering hops. All are
away to the harvest-field. Let us go there too. We are all bidden
guests at Farmer Drayton’s, and our holiday will pass merrily among
the reapers.

[Illustration: AUTUMN

THE REAPERS.]

“Good morning, Goody! Where are you going with your troop of rosy
children, all glee and gossip?” “To the harvest-field, young masters.
’Tis a pleasant time, that comes but once a year, and we make the most
of it. My master was out before the sun, reaping in the field beside
the river; but I had to dress the children and get his dinner, and
that makes me late.” “Good day, then; we will not hinder you.” Away
she goes, half running, the children out of breath with delight. They
have turned into Johnson’s field. Let us follow them. There they are
with twenty or thirty others, gathering the scattered ears, as Ruth
gathered them on the plains of Bethlehem. Look at Goody! How diligently
she is picking up the ears! The children, too, are all helping. Before
the season is over, they will collect at least three clear bushels of
wheat; and if the weather prove showery, and the wagon is hurried to
the barn, they will obtain a larger quantity.

Farmer Johnson is at the farthest end, watching his reapers. He looks
pleased, and with reason, for the rustling corn stands thick, and
the men work cheerfully. The Lord of the Field, (for such the chief
reaper is called,) heads the long line of farming servants. When he
clasps the opposite ears in his strong arms, they clasp theirs also;
when he thrusts his sickle, they do the same; and there is presently
laid low a wide extent of grain, with its garniture of flowers,—the
corn-cockle, and scarlet-poppy, sweet basil, and marjoram, herbs
Robert and Christopher, Cicily and William—names by which old simplers
commemorated worth or friendship, or the villagers of other days
associated with the memory of benefactors, whose skill and kindness
might be shadowed forth in the qualities of their favorite plants.
It seems as if those who bind up the sheaves have some pleasant or
grateful thoughts connected with the prostrate flower, for a few are
carefully taken from among the rest and put aside.

Before the young wheat springs up, we shall hear, I fancy, the
church-bells ringing merrily, for there are John Gray and Susan Bell
hard at work. He has just pulled the prickly stems of the woolly
thistle from the corn she is about to bind. Farmer Johnson often tells
the men and women to mind their work; but he takes no notice of John
and Susan, though many a kindly word passes between them, for he knows
that more industrious and well-conducted young persons are no where to
be found.

THE PARROT.


    The deep affections of the breast,
      That Heaven to living things imparts
    Are not exclusively possess’d
      By human hearts.

    A parrot, from the Spanish Main,
      Full young, and early-caged came o’er,
    With bright wings, to the bleak domain.
      Of Mulla’s shore.

    To spicy groves where he had won
      His plumage of resplendent hue—
    His native fruits, and skies, and sun—
      He bade adieu.

    For these he changed the smoke of turf,
      A heathery land and misty sky;
    And turn’d on rocks and raging surf
      His golden eye.

    But, petted, in our climate cold,
      He lived and chatter’d many a day;
    Until, with age, from green and gold
      His wings grew gray.

    At last, when blind and seeming dumb,
      He scolded, laugh’d, and spoke no more,
    A Spanish stranger chanced to come
      To Mulla’s shore.

    He hail’d the bird in Spanish speech,
      The bird in Spanish speech replied;
    Flapt round his cage with joyous screech,
      Dropt down and died.

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
