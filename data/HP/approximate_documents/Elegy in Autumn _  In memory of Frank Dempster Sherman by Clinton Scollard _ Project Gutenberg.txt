ELEGY IN AUTUMN


I

  Brother in song, you who have gone before
      Along far incommunicable ways,
  Leaving me here upon this mortal shore,
      A bondman to the tyrant nights and days,
            Across the distance, hail!
  Though Time may sever, and we meet no more,
            Yet what shall Time avail!


II

  ’Twas Autumn when we first set hand to hand,
      And eye to eye, in loyal comradeship;
  Drowsed with a draught of Beauty seemed the land,
      As it had raised a golden cup to lip;
            But you embodied Spring,
  Its harvest hopes, its deeds in joyance planned,
            Its brave adventuring.


III

  I can recall your buoyance,--can recall
      The star-sown hours beneath the Cambridge trees,
  When o’er us wheeled the bright processional
      Of bold Orion and the Pleiades,
            And how we strolled along
  Laughterful, and oblivious to all
            Save the sweet thrall of Song.


IV

  Youth has its visions and its fervors; yours
      Were lovingly enlinked with Poesy;
  You dreamed the dream that many an one allures,
      The vernal dream where life is harmony.
            And though the years estranged
  Your full allegiance, something still assures
            My heart you never changed.


V

  What merriment was ours those shut-in nights
      When Winter, clamorous at the casement, cried!
  What dear association, what delights
      As we in friendly emulation vied,
            While Aspiration’s cruse
  Was brimmed for us, beholding on dim heights
            The presence of the Muse!


VI

  And then there opened wider paths to tread
      When Love, with Song, beguiled you on and on,
  While Art around your feet unfaltering shed
      Its luminous light, irradiant as the dawn;
            Though you saw many part
  From deities long worshipped, you were wed
            Inalienably to Art.


VII

  What though the rigid chains of circumstance
      Oft held you in the trammels of the town,
  Your heart went woodward where the fairies dance
      What time the moon its silvery sheen sifts down.
            You loved the reeds and rills,
  The sea, the shore, their glamour and romance,
            And all the climbing hills.


VIII

  And when you made escape, and sensed the wild
      Aromas beat about you, when you fared
  By tracks unwonted, like an unleashed child
      You gleefully your gay abandon shared.
            Care from your shoulders thrown,
  You seemed an Ariel spirit, long exiled,
            Come back unto its own.


IX

  With gracious Memory again I go
      To tread with you where meads are green and gold,
  Where upland slopes are strewn with daisy-snow,
      And bee-balm torches light the flocks to fold,
            And willow branches wave
  Above Oriskany, singing far below
            Its liquid summer stave.


X

  Now south we sail where stormy currents meet
      Round the wind-harassed cape of Hatteras,
  Beyond whose beacons, when the tides retreat,
      The wide sea-mirror is like burnished glass;
            There, ’mid the drowsy calms,
  As Ponce de Leon did of yore, we greet
            The tall Floridian palms.


XI

  Here down the live-oak aisles ’tis ours to stray
      With wraiths of many a stern conquistador,
  Those vanished warriors of an elder day
      When gray San Marco bore the brunt of war;
            Here we in revery lean
  Upon the ramparts beetling o’er the bay,
            And watch the shifting scene;--


XII

  The boats that dip and dart like living things,
      Seeking the open sea beyond the bar;
  The graceful gulls with sunlight on their wings
      Up the Matanzas soaring fleet and far
            Where inlets deep beguile;
  And o’er the waters undulant shimmerings
            The low coquina isle.


XIII

  Then, at the drooping of the twilight hour,
      We wander in the ancient plaza where
  We breathe the attar of the jasmine flower
      Like incense on the altar of the air;
            And list, as music swells
  Down drifting from the old cathedral tower,
            The arpeggio of the bells.


XIV

  We linger by the sea-wall while the tide
      Below us murmurs like a sad refrain,
  Bearing from outer ocean reaches wide
      The lore and legend of the Spanish main,
            Nor leave that spot serene
  Till Sleep, as with the mantle of the bride,
            Wraps fair Saint Augustine.


XV

  Days dedicate to rapturous things were these;
      It was as though Youth came again, and brought
  Past aims, past ardors and past ecstasies,
      And toward the shrine of Beauty turned our thought.
            And there were after times
  Of exultation, prismic harmonies,
            When hours ran by in rhymes.


XVI

  Once, ’mid cathedral Carolinian pines,
      We saw the Springtide, at its radiant birth,
  Kindle to fragrant gold the coiling vines,
      And make a garden of the wakened earth;
            And every morning heard
  Within the treetops, melody linked with mirth,
            The hidden mocking-bird.


XVII

  And while the cardinal through the waving bredes
      Of pendulous moss swift flitted like a flame,
  Back flooded to our minds the illustrious deeds,
      Emblazoned on the honor-scroll of Fame,
            When Liberty was won,
  Hearkening the Ashley whisper to its reeds
            The name of Marion.


XVIII

  From Gloucester cliffs and brown Nantucket dunes
      The mountains lured you, and the mountain star;
  For us the Woodland sang its lyric runes
      Where’er we followed it, or near or far,
            In sun or shadow cool,
  Or loitered through long languorous afternoons
            By Dian’s darkling pool.


XIX

  Far up the valley Wittenberg’s vast form,
      Its summit beckoning, with you I view,
  And above sweeping slopes where wild bees swarm
      Glimpse timid deer at dawn and fall of dew;
            Through Panther Kill we roam,
  And mark the purple streamers of the storm
            Ascend behind the Dome.


XX

  And, too, in bookmen’s mines of dusty ore
      Ever shall I remember how we delved,
  Plucking from out the musty treasure-store
      Rich rarities within the darkness shelved,
            Elated if we found
  Leaves that some name we long had honored bore
            In frayed morocco bound.


XXI

  Thus, step by step, we trod adown the years,
      Thus, side by side, with ne’er a break between;
  We shared our laughter and we shared our tears,
      Nor deemed inexorable Fate might intervene
            To sever the strong cord
  That bound us, Fate with its “abhorrèd shears,”
            That is man’s over-lord.


XXII

  You that in Autumn came, in Autumn went;
      How vain to say the mourning word! how vain
  To beat the bars of that arbitrament
      That metes to mortals pleasurement or pain!
            How vain!--how vain!--and yet
  We beat upon them, and we only gain
            The poignance of regret!


XXIII

  Autumn again with all its loveliness;
      Autumn again that brought an end to joy,
  Despite the sight of earth in amber dress,
      And airs that bear the blitheness of a boy!
            Autumn, and leaves that toss
  In bright brief triumphing, while they express
            The brooding sense of loss.


XXIV

  Autumn again down every winding way
      That, in the days gone by, our footsteps pressed!--
  Instead of woven amaranth would I lay
      Above your dust--you gone by paths unguessed--
            Love’s deathless asphodel;
  Until some happier hour,--when, who shall say?--
            Brother in song, farewell!

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
