                          everybody knows joe

                          By C. M. Kornbluth

                   At least two persons live in each
                  of us. At least one of them is Joe.

    _For a young man Cyril Kornbluth has been around a long time--at
    least in the upper reaches of science fiction and fantasy writing.
    His "Little Black Gag" is already accepted as a classic, his
    collaborations with Judith Merril "Mars Child" and Frederik Pohl
    "The Space Merchants," novels of high entertainment and worth. We
    are delighted to present him in a little story that should scare
    the pants off everybody._

               Fantastic Universe October-November 1953.
         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that
         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]


Joe had quite a day for himself Thursday and as usual I had to tag
along. If I had a right arm to give I'd give it for a day off now and
then. Like on Thursday. On Thursday he really outdid himself.

He woke up in the hotel room and had a shower. He wasn't going to shave
until I told him he looked like a bum. So he shaved and then he stood
for a whole minute admiring his beauty in the mirror, forgetting whose
idea it was in the first place.

So down to the coffee shop for breakfast. A hard-working man needs a
good breakfast. So getting ready for a backbreaking day of copying
references at the library, he had tomato juice, two fried eggs, three
sausages, a sugared doughnut and coffee--with cream and sugar.

He couldn't work that off his pot in a week of ditch-digging under
a July sun, but a hard-working man needs a good breakfast. I was
too disgusted to argue with him. He's hopeless when he smells that
short-order smell of smoking grease, frying bacon and coffee.

He wanted to take a taxi to the library--eight blocks!

"Walk, you jerk!" I told him. He started to mumble about pulling down
six hundred bucks for this week's work and then he must have thought
I was going to mention the high-calorie breakfast. To him that's
hitting below the belt. He thinks he's an unfortunate man with an
affliction--about twenty pounds of it. He walked and arrived at the
library glowing with virtue.

       *       *       *       *       *

Making out his slip at the newspaper room he blandly put down next to
_firm_--_The Griffin Press, Inc._--when he knew as well as I did that
he was a free lance and hadn't even got a definite assignment from
Griffin.

There's a line on the slip where you put down _reason for consulting
files (please be specific)_. It's a shame to cramp Joe's style to
just one line after you pitch him an essay-type question like that.
He squeezed in, _Preparation of article on year in biochemistry for
Griffin Pr. Encyc. 1952 Yrbk._, and handed it with a flourish to the
librarian.

The librarian, a nice old man, was polite to him, which is usually
a mistake with Joe. After he finished telling the librarian how his
microfilm files ought to be organized and how they ought to switch from
microfilm to microcard and how in spite of everything the New York
Public Library wasn't such a bad place to research, he got down to work.

He's pretty harmless when he's working--it's one of the things that
keeps me from cutting his throat. With a noon break for apple pie and
coffee he transcribed about a hundred entries onto his cards, mopping
up the year in biochemistry nicely. He swaggered down the library
steps, feeling like Herman Melville after finishing Moby Dick.

"Don't be so smug," I told him. "You still have to write the piece. And
they still have to buy it."

"A detail," he said grandly. "Just journalism. I can do it with my eyes
shut."

Just journalism. Somehow his three months of running copy for the A.P.
before the war has made him an Ed Leahy.

"_When_ are you going to do it with your eyes...?" I began but it
wasn't any use. He began telling me about how Gautama Buddha didn't
break with the world until he was 29 and Mohammed didn't announce that
he was a prophet until he was 30, so why couldn't _he_ one of these
days suddenly bust loose with a new revelation or something and set the
world on its ear? What it boiled down to was he didn't think he'd write
the article tonight.

He postponed his break with the world long enough to have a ham and
cheese on rye and more coffee at an automat and then phoned Maggie. She
was available as usual. She said as usual, "Well then, why don't you
just drop by and we'll spend a quiet evening with some records?"

As usual he thought that would be fine since he was so beat after a
hard day. As usual I told him, "You're a louse, Joe. You know all she
wants is a husband and you know it isn't going to be you, so why don't
you let go of the girl so she can find somebody who means business?"

The usual answers rolled out automatically and we got that out of the
way.

Maybe Maggie isn't very bright but she seemed glad to see him. She's
shooting for her Doctorate in sociology at N.Y.U., she does part-time
case work for the city, she has one of those three-room Greenwich
Village apartments with dyed burlap drapes and studio couches and
home-made mobiles. She thinks writing is something holy and Joe's
careful not to tell her different.

They drank some rhine wine and seltzer while Joe talked about the
day's work as though he'd won the Nobel prize for biochemistry. He got
downright brutal about Maggie being mixed up in such an approximate
unquantitative excuse for a science as sociology and she apologized
humbly and eventually he forgave her. Big-hearted Joe.

But he wasn't so fried that he _had_ to start talking about a man
wanting to settle down--"not this year but maybe next. Thirty's a
dividing point that makes you stop and wonder what you really want and
what you've really got out of life, Maggie darlin'." It was as good as
telling her that she should be a good girl and continue to keep open
house for him and maybe some day ... maybe.

As I said, maybe Maggie isn't very bright. But as I also said,
Thursday was the day Joe picked to outdo himself.

"Joe," she said with this look on her face, "I got a new LP of the
Brahms Serenade Number One. It's on top of the stack. Would you tell me
what you think of it?"

So he put it on and they sat sipping rhine wine and seltzer and he
turned it over and they sat sipping rhine wine and seltzer until both
sides were played. And she kept watching him. Not adoringly.

"Well," she asked with this new look, "what did you think of it?"

He told her, of course. There was some comment on Brahms'
architectonics and his resurrection of the contrapuntal style. Because
he'd sneaked a look at the record's envelope he was able to spend a
couple of minutes on Brahms' debt to Haydn and the young Beethoven in
the fifth movement (_allegro_, D Major) and the gay _rondo_ of the--

"Joe," she said, not looking at him. "Joe," she said, "I got that
record at one hell of a discount down the street. It's a wrong
pressing. Somehow the first side is the first half of the Serenade but
the second half is Schumann's Symphonic Studies Opus Thirteen. Somebody
noticed it when they played it in a booth. But I guess you didn't
notice it."

"Get out of _this one_, braino," I told him.

He got up and said in a strangled voice, "And I thought you were my
friend. I suppose I'll never learn." He walked out.

I suppose he never will.

God help me, I ought to know.

Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
