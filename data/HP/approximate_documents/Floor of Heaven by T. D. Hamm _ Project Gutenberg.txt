The three crew members of the Ad Astra looked at one another, grinning
weakly, in the whispering silence after the motors had kicked off. This
was the culminating point of a half-century of preparation; behind them
was the satellite launching station--ahead of them, a faint red dot,
was Mars.

Bryan, nominal head of the expedition, touched the shutter studs that
opened their windows on the universe. They stood silently, the three of
them; Bryan and Hughes looking back at the majesty of the retreating
Earth--Williams, rigid with ecstasy at the forward port.

The stars were his passion and his joy. Women filled a momentary
need, men he accepted or rejected as they could help him to achieve
his goal. Now, as astrogator of the Ad Astra he had fulfilled his
dream; and now before him Canopus, Rigel, Cassiopeia and Aldebaran lay
jewel-like on the dark velvet of space.

How stars had absorbed the thoughts of mankind since the beginning, he
thought happily, and what dreams had the ancient Chaldeans known as
they mapped the routes of the galleons of space? And the poets.... "See
how the floor of Heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold--"
he quoted softly.

"My, that's pretty," Bryan said solemnly behind him. "Who said that?"

"Williams did--" returned Hughes equally dead-pan.

Williams flushed under their good-natured grins. "Shakespeare said it,
you uneducated yokels," he said loftily. "How come you aren't cheating
each other at gin rummy yet? Last I heard one of you owed the other a
million dollars."

"It was only six hundred thousand," Hughes grinned, "and I'm about to
take him double or nothing!"

       *       *       *       *       *

The weeks passed slowly. Barely audible, the computers ticked, keeping
the ship on course. Bryan and Hughes wrangled amiably over their
interminable card-games, throwing an occasional, joking aside to
Williams watching the stars, absorbed as a miser fingering his jewels.

Mars, from a minute speck, grew to a planet lying bloody in the
cold rays of the distant sun. Strapped down in obedience to the
computer-given signal, the ship reversed, fired its rockets and touched
down on her supporting pillars of flame and became only a shining
needle dwarfed in the immensity of the pinkish-red desert.

They looked at each other doubtfully, conscious of anti-climax. This
was little different from the far reaches of the Gobi plateau where
they had trained for weary, boring months. Bryan and Hughes drew the
lots as the two to don their heated, protective suits and explore
within cautious distance of the ship. Williams, restless and bored,
watched their horseplay resentfully. Even the tenuous atmosphere of the
dead world dimmed the splendor of the heavens; why didn't they hurry
and get it over with? He shivered a little watching Bryan and Hughes
trudging clumsily in the sand, throwing out a comment occasionally for
the benefit of the tape recorder in the cabin.

"This is different from the deserts back home," Hughes said. "Back
there you get the feeling they're just waiting for somebody to move in,
but here...."

"It's more like a haunted house," Bryan finished for him. Williams,
adjusting his headphones, was conscious of a deepening of his faint
uneasiness--why didn't they hurry up and get back! All they really had
to do was build a cairn and plant the Federation flag. They had found a
few rocks and Bryan was stooping to bury the prepared canister with the
data of the flight--

Williams watching incredulously as Bryan and Hughes reeled and
staggered, was dimly conscious of a sudden faint tremor along the ship.
There was an abrupt metallic shrieking in his headset, a background of
thundering, grinding bedlam, and over it Bryan's voice frantic--

"Cave-in! Lift ship--_lift ship_!"

It had been the one constant in the shifting, nebulous mass of theory
drilled into them. _They_ were valuable--the _ship_ was irreplaceable.
With a last unbelieving look of horror at the gigantic crack widening
under the very feet of his companions, Williams threw himself into
the control seat and threw the lever over to "takeoff" position. The
rockets fired and the ship rose majestically, the thousand foot fiery
splendor of her trail blotting out the space-suited figures toppling
into the thundering chasm.

Hours later, Williams pulled himself up, looking around dazedly. The
motors had shut off and the great ship was coasting noiselessly along
the return track; only the computers ticked steadily and the air-valves
made a muted shushing in the silence. Funny he hadn't noticed the
silence on the way out--sometimes he had even been irritated with the
noise Bryan and Hughes had made with their eternal wrangling over their
cards. Automatically he pushed the forward viewing plate button feeling
the familiar sense of timeless peace as he looked out on the eternal
suns.

Mechanically he ate and slept in the days that followed, dimly aware
of a giggling, wild-eyed stranger in some remote corner of his mind,
waiting to overtake him if he showed awareness of his presence. He
pushed away too, the thought of Bryan and Hughes, forgetting in the
sameness of his days that he had ever been anything but alone. At first
he had cried a little in his lonesomeness, but as the weeks went on
he remembered only that once there had been others who had deserted
him. He nodded familiarly to the stars, smiling a little; there was
only himself and them, shining steadfastly above him. They would never
change--never desert him!

Time went by unnoticed. The green dot of Earth became a glowing green
and blue orb, circled by a tiny white dot. The computer changed its
rhythm--above the control board the "strap-in" warning flashed unseen
as the rockets fired swinging the ship into the turnover, ready for
orbit with the satellite ferry station. Williams gazing with dreamy
pleasure at the jewelled curtain above him was hurled against the port
by the sudden surge of acceleration. The ship heeled over, twisted,
then turned----

Williams hung head down, screaming, as the black curtain tore, the
stars falling dizzily away--_below_ him....

[Illustration: _He screamed once, falling face down through the stars,
through the gold-inlaid, dizzying, beautiful, sickening...._]

       *       *       *       *       *

A year later, the psychiatrists, quite pleased with themselves found
him ready for duty again; not in Space of course, but the hero of the
first Mars expedition was always sure of a job with Space Authority.
Now he could even look up at the stars at night without screaming with
vertigo.

Tonight walking confidently along the country road, fragrant and
dotted with shining pools after the recent rain, he looked up thinking
nostalgically, "the patines of bright gold...."

A coldness about his feet halted him. He looked down and once again the
black curtain tore before his eyes--once more they were there, the cold
unfriendly stars, swinging in the empty void--

Below him.

Falling downward past the whirling suns, he screamed, hardly aware of
the choking wetness in his lungs....

About him the inch-deep shining pool rippled for a moment and was
still, reflecting once more the floor of Heaven.

Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
