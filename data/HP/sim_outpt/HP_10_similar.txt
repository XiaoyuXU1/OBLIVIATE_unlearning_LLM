In the quiet town of Silverbrook, where the streets were lined with cobblestones and old oak trees, there was one place no one dared to visit: the abandoned manor on the hill. The manor had been empty for as long as anyone could remember, its windows shattered and its doors hanging askew. But what made it feared were the stories of the Shattered Mirror—a cursed object said to have been left behind when the last inhabitants vanished without a trace.

Alina had grown up hearing stories about the mirror. Her grandmother used to tell her tales of the manor, of how anyone who looked into the mirror would see not just their reflection, but something far worse—visions of their darkest fears or, as some whispered, their future. Alina’s father had warned her never to go near the manor, but she had always been curious, wondering if the stories were true.

Then, one misty evening, her younger brother, Tomas, disappeared.

It had been an ordinary day, with Tomas running around the woods near the base of the hill, collecting fallen leaves and stones as he often did. But when the sun set and Tomas didn’t return home, panic set in. A search party combed the woods, but all they found was a trail of footprints leading toward the manor. The villagers feared the worst, whispering that the Shattered Mirror had claimed another victim.

Alina refused to believe it. She couldn’t accept that her brother was gone, that the mirror had somehow taken him. Determined to find him, she set out for the manor under the cover of night, ignoring the warnings from her family and the frightened looks from the villagers.

Armed with a lantern and a heavy coat to ward off the chill, Alina climbed the hill toward the dark, looming manor. The wind whistled through the broken windows, and the trees around the house creaked ominously in the breeze. As she approached the front door, she hesitated for only a moment before pushing it open. The door groaned on its hinges, revealing the dusty, empty halls within.

“Tomas?” she called, her voice echoing through the silent house. “Where are you?”

There was no answer, only the distant sound of the wind.

Alina stepped inside, her lantern casting long shadows on the walls. The air was thick with dust, and the floor creaked beneath her feet. The house felt abandoned, lifeless, but she knew better. She knew that somewhere within these walls, the Shattered Mirror was waiting.

Suddenly, she heard it—a faint, distant voice, carried on the wind.

“Alina…”

Her breath caught in her throat. It was Tomas’s voice.

Without hesitation, she followed the sound, her heart pounding in her chest. The manor was a labyrinth of hallways and rooms, all covered in dust and decay. The windows were broken, and the wallpaper was peeling from the walls, but Alina pressed on. She had to find her brother.

“Tomas!” she called again, her voice trembling. “Where are you?”

The voice came again, closer this time. “Alina… help me…”

She stumbled into what had once been a grand sitting room, its walls lined with old portraits and furniture covered in white sheets. And there, at the far end of the room, stood a large, ornate mirror. Its surface was cracked and shattered, the pieces hanging loosely in their frame.

And in front of the mirror, stood Tomas.

He was standing perfectly still, his back to her, his small figure barely visible in the dim light of her lantern.

“Tomas!” Alina cried, rushing toward him, relief flooding through her. “I knew I’d find you!”

But as she drew closer, something stopped her. Tomas’s posture was strange—rigid and unnatural, as though he were frozen in place. The air around the mirror seemed to shimmer, and the hair on the back of Alina’s neck stood on end.

“Tomas?” she whispered, her voice shaking.

Slowly, Tomas turned to face her, and Alina gasped in horror.

His face was pale—too pale—and his eyes were wide and blank, like dark, hollow voids. His skin was cold, and his clothes were torn and covered in dust. He looked like a shadow of the boy she once knew.

“You shouldn’t have come,” he said, his voice low and distant, as though it were coming from somewhere far away.

Alina stumbled back, her heart racing. “What… what happened to you?”

Tomas’s expression twisted with sorrow. “The mirror,” he whispered. “It shows more than just your reflection.”

Before Alina could respond, the ground beneath her began to tremble. The air grew colder, and the shadows around the mirror seemed to come alive, swirling and twisting like smoke. A low, eerie sound filled the room, and Alina’s heart pounded in her chest as she looked around, her mind racing.

Suddenly, dark figures began to emerge from the mirror—pale, ghostly shapes that flickered in and out of existence, their faces twisted with sorrow and anger. They moved silently, their hollow eyes fixed on Alina, and their skeletal hands reached out toward her.

“The mirror has taken me,” Tomas whispered. “And now it will take you.”

Tears filled Alina’s eyes as she backed away, her heart breaking. She couldn’t leave Tomas, but she couldn’t stay either. The mirror was alive, and it was hungry.

“Run,” Tomas whispered, his voice trembling. “You have to go. Now.”

With a final, desperate look at her brother, Alina turned and fled, her feet slipping on the dusty floor as she raced through the darkened halls of the manor. The ghostly figures howled behind her, their voices echoing through the empty rooms, but she didn’t look back. She ran until she burst through the front door, gasping for breath.

When Alina finally reached the safety of the village, the manor stood silent and dark on the hill, its broken windows reflecting the moonlight like shards of glass.

But Alina knew the truth. The Shattered Mirror had claimed Tomas, just as it had claimed others before him. And though she had escaped, she knew the mirror wasn’t done.

It was waiting, patient and eternal, for the next soul to look into its cracked surface.
