In the windswept highlands of Elaria, the once-great city of Meridon stands as a hollow shell of its former glory. The city’s downfall came when the Orb of Myrannis, a powerful magical artifact said to control the flow of time itself, was broken during a failed rebellion. Its shattering unleashed a chaotic force that plunged the region into a timeless limbo, where the sun never rises, and the moon never sets. The people of Meridon now live in fear, trapped in an endless twilight, their lives suspended between day and night.

Aelis, a young mage trained in the ancient arts, arrives in Meridon seeking to undo the damage caused by the rebellion. She is haunted by her own past—a failed apprentice who once tried to wield the power of the Orb herself and was cast out by the mages who guarded it. Now, driven by guilt and a desire for redemption, Aelis believes she can repair the shattered Orb and restore the natural order of time to the land.

She is joined by Caden, a former soldier of Meridon who fought in the rebellion and bears the scars of battle, both physical and emotional. He lost everything when the Orb shattered—his comrades, his home, and his faith in the cause he once believed in. Though he has no love for magic, Caden agrees to guide Aelis through the perilous ruins of Meridon, where the fragments of the Orb lie scattered and heavily guarded by creatures born of the magical distortion.

Their journey is fraught with danger, as the magic unleashed by the Orb’s destruction has warped not only the city but also its people. Strange anomalies appear in the sky—glimpses of other times and places—and ghostly apparitions of past events play out in the streets. The deeper they go into the heart of the city, the more they encounter twisted beasts and powerful magical forces that defy all logic. Worse still, the remnants of the rebellion—now a group of rogue mages—are hunting them, determined to use the Orb’s fragments for their own gain.

Aelis and Caden must race against time—literally—if they are to find the Orb’s pieces before the rogue mages do. Along the way, they discover that the rebellion’s leader, a mage named Theron, has survived and is actively working to rebuild the Orb. But unlike Aelis, Theron seeks not to restore balance but to control the flow of time itself, believing he can rewrite history and undo the mistakes of the past. He views the chaos caused by the shattered Orb as an opportunity rather than a curse.

As Aelis and Caden track down the fragments, they face not only external threats but also the internal struggle of trust. Caden harbors a deep resentment toward mages, blaming them for the destruction of Meridon, while Aelis is consumed by the fear that she may once again fail, as she did in her past. Their bond is tested as the stakes grow higher, with Caden slowly coming to terms with his past and Aelis learning to embrace the responsibility of her power.

In the climactic battle, they confront Theron at the ruins of the Temple of Myrannis, where the last and most powerful fragment of the Orb is kept. Theron, having already gathered most of the Orb’s pieces, uses its unstable power to manipulate time around them, creating illusions of alternate realities and moments from their pasts. Aelis and Caden must fight not only Theron but also the versions of themselves that Theron’s magic conjures—each representing their deepest fears and regrets.

In a final act of defiance, Aelis chooses not to rebuild the Orb as it was but to destroy its remaining fragments, releasing the magic trapped within. This breaks the curse on the land and restores the natural flow of time, but at great cost—Theron’s manipulation of time causes a rift that threatens to consume the city. Aelis uses her remaining magic to close the rift, saving Meridon but sacrificing her own powers in the process.

As the sun rises over Meridon for the first time in years, the city begins to rebuild, its people free from the grip of timelessness. Aelis, now powerless but at peace with her choices, bids farewell to Caden, who has found a renewed sense of purpose. Together, they leave the ruins of Meridon behind, knowing that while they have saved the city, their journey—and their struggle for redemption—is far from over.
