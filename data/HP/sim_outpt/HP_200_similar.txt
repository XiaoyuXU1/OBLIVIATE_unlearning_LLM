In the ancient kingdom of Eldorvale, where magical creatures roamed the forests and castles were built atop misty mountains, there was a tradition that all kingdoms eagerly anticipated—the Enchanted Feast. The Feast was no ordinary event; it was held every hundred years and gathered the most gifted mages, warriors, and scholars from across the land. Legends said that those who attended the Feast were chosen to witness an ancient ceremony that could reveal hidden powers or grant the gift of foresight. The celebration was filled with grandeur, magic, and alliances that shaped the future of the realm.

Arin, a young mage in training, had never imagined he would be among the few invited to the Enchanted Feast. His skills were still developing, and he often felt out of place among the more experienced mages. But his mentor, the wise and mysterious Eloria, insisted that he had potential, and now he was walking into the grand hall of Eldorvale Castle, where the Feast would be held.

Alongside Arin was his best friend, Rowan, a skilled archer and tracker. Rowan had never been interested in magic, but the adventure of attending such a prestigious event drew him in. The two friends were an unlikely pair—one driven by the mysteries of magic, the other by the thrill of exploration—but together, they made an unbreakable team.

The entrance hall of the castle was buzzing with excitement. Nobles, scholars, and warriors from different regions mingled, their colorful robes and intricate armor reflecting the light from enchanted lanterns that floated above them. The grand oak doors that led to the banquet hall would open at sunset, signaling the start of the Feast.

"Look at this place," Rowan marveled, glancing around at the crowd. "I’ve never seen so many people from different kingdoms in one room. And I’ve definitely never seen so much magic in the air."

Arin adjusted his simple mage’s robe, feeling slightly underdressed compared to the grand attire around him. "It’s overwhelming, to be honest. I’m just hoping I don’t trip over my own feet when we’re supposed to meet the council."

Rowan grinned. "I wouldn’t worry. You’ll be too busy staring at all the magical artifacts they’re about to show off."

Just as they were speaking, a group of nobles from the southern kingdom of Veridia passed by, their elegant robes shimmering in the light. One of them, a girl with a crown of silver leaves, caught Rowan’s eye. She smiled politely before disappearing into the crowd.

Arin nudged Rowan, smirking. "Already making new friends?"

Before Rowan could reply, the oak doors creaked open, and a voice called, "Guests of the Enchanted Feast, please enter the banquet hall!"

The crowd moved forward, and Arin and Rowan followed, entering the vast hall. The sight that greeted them took their breath away. The hall was unlike anything they had ever seen. The ceiling was enchanted to reflect the night sky, with stars twinkling above their heads. Long tables were set with golden plates and goblets, and in the center of the room was a massive chandelier made of glowing crystals that seemed to hum with magic.

At the far end of the hall, seated on an elevated platform, was the Council of Eldorvale—a group of powerful figures who oversaw the Feast and the ancient traditions that came with it. Among them was Eloria, who caught Arin’s eye and gave him a subtle nod.

"This is incredible," Arin whispered. "I can’t believe we’re actually here."

Rowan, though equally impressed, noticed something else. "Look, over there. Do you see those guards by the doors? There’s more security here than I expected. It’s almost as if they’re worried about something."

Arin followed Rowan’s gaze and saw the armored guards standing near the entrances, their eyes scanning the crowd. "You’re right. I wonder what’s going on."

The two friends took their seats at one of the long tables, joining a group of young scholars and warriors from different kingdoms. As they sat down, the head of the Council, a regal figure with a long silver beard, stood and raised his goblet.

"Welcome, honored guests, to the Enchanted Feast of Eldorvale!" he announced, his voice carrying across the hall. "Tonight, we gather to celebrate unity, knowledge, and the mysteries of magic. But this Feast is more than just a celebration. It is a reminder of the power we share and the responsibility that comes with it. And for those chosen by the ancient magic of Eldorvale, tonight will mark the beginning of a journey unlike any other."

A murmur went through the crowd. Arin exchanged a glance with Rowan, who shrugged.

"Chosen by the ancient magic?" Rowan whispered. "What does that mean?"

Arin shook his head. "I don’t know, but it sounds important."

As the Feast continued, food appeared on the golden plates—enchanted delicacies from all corners of the realm. Roasted pheasant, spiced fruits, and pastries that shimmered with magical dust. The guests dined and mingled, and the hall was filled with the sound of laughter and conversation.

But despite the merriment, Arin couldn’t shake the feeling that something was about to happen. The air felt charged with energy, and the guards by the doors seemed tense. He looked toward Eloria, who was watching the crowd with a serious expression.

Suddenly, the chandelier above the hall flickered, and the lights dimmed. The music stopped, and a hush fell over the room. The Council members stood, their faces grave.

"The time has come," the head of the Council said, his voice low and ominous. "The ancient magic has chosen its champions."

A collective gasp went through the crowd. Arin’s heart raced. He had heard stories of the Feast choosing champions, but no one knew what it meant or what happened to those chosen. The Council members raised their hands, and a soft glow filled the room, emanating from the chandelier.

One by one, figures in the crowd began to glow with the same light. Gasps of surprise and awe echoed through the hall as the guests realized who had been chosen. To Arin’s shock, the light surrounded him and Rowan.

"Arin..." Rowan whispered, his voice filled with disbelief. "We’ve been chosen."

Arin could barely process what was happening. The glowing light surrounded him, warm and powerful, and he felt a connection to something ancient and immense. Eloria’s words echoed in his mind—about potential, about destiny.

The head of the Council stepped forward. "To those who have been chosen, the path ahead will not be easy. The ancient magic has selected you for a great purpose. Beyond this hall lies a journey filled with danger, discovery, and trials. But if you succeed, the rewards will be beyond anything you can imagine. You will become guardians of the realm, protectors of the light."

Arin’s breath caught in his throat. He looked at Rowan, who was pale but determined.

"This is it," Arin said quietly. "This is what we’ve been waiting for."

Together, they rose from their seats, along with the other chosen guests, and approached the Council. The path ahead was uncertain, but Arin knew that whatever came next, he and Rowan would face it together. The Enchanted Feast had marked the beginning of an adventure that would change their lives—and the fate of Eldorvale—forever.
