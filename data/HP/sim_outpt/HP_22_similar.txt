In the frigid, wind-swept plains of the north, far beyond the last outposts of civilization, there stood an ancient relic—the Frozen Obelisk. It was a towering structure of ice and stone, said to be older than memory, imbued with powerful magic that controlled the very forces of winter. The obelisk had been lost for centuries, buried beneath endless snow and ice, but it was whispered that those who found it could command the harshest elements. However, the obelisk was also cursed—those who sought its power were said to be frozen in time, trapped forever in its icy grip.

Sasha had always been fascinated by the tales of the Frozen Obelisk. Her grandfather, an explorer, had dedicated his life to finding the obelisk, believing it held the secret to controlling the severe winters that plagued their land. But when her grandfather disappeared during his final expedition, leaving behind only a map and a journal, Sasha became obsessed with the obelisk. She believed that finding it would not only bring her grandfather back but also end the endless winter.

Then, one icy morning, her younger sister, Lia, disappeared.

Lia had always been curious about their grandfather’s work and often talked about retracing his steps. Despite Sasha’s warnings, Lia had been sneaking out to the snowy plains, determined to find the obelisk herself. But when Lia didn’t return from her walk, Sasha’s heart filled with dread. The villagers searched for her, but all they found was her scarf, caught on a branch near the entrance to the frozen wilderness. The whispers spread quickly—Lia had gone after the Frozen Obelisk, and the ice had claimed her.

But Sasha refused to believe it. She couldn’t accept that her sister was gone, that the obelisk had somehow taken her. Determined to find Lia, Sasha made up her mind to venture into the frozen plains, despite the dangers and the warnings from the elders.

With her grandfather’s map and a fur-lined cloak to protect her from the biting cold, Sasha set out into the endless snow. The wind howled around her, and the ground was covered in a thick blanket of ice, but she pressed on, the weight of the frozen wilderness bearing down on her. As the hours passed, the snow became deeper, and the cold more intense, but Sasha didn’t stop.

“Lia?” Sasha called, her voice muffled by the wind. “Where are you?”

There was no answer, only the deafening howl of the wind as it whipped through the frozen landscape.

As Sasha continued her trek, the air grew even colder, and the snow beneath her feet crunched ominously. The frozen plains seemed to stretch on forever, their white expanse broken only by the jagged peaks of distant mountains. The deeper she ventured into the wilderness, the more oppressive the cold became, as though the very air around her was alive with icy magic.

“Lia?” she called again, her voice rising with desperation. “I’m here!”

Suddenly, she heard it—a faint, distant voice, carried on the wind.

“Sasha…”

Her breath caught in her throat. It was Lia’s voice.

Without hesitation, Sasha hurried toward the sound, her cloak flapping in the wind. The snow swirled around her, making it difficult to see, but she didn’t stop. She had to find her sister.

“Lia!” she called again, her voice filled with hope. “I’m coming!”

The voice came again, closer this time. “Sasha… help me…”

She stumbled into a clearing at the base of a towering structure—the Frozen Obelisk. The obelisk stood tall and foreboding, its surface shimmering with frost and glowing faintly in the dim light. The air around it was so cold that Sasha’s breath froze instantly in the air. And there, standing near the obelisk, was Lia.

She stood perfectly still, her back to Sasha, her figure barely visible through the swirling snow.

“Lia!” Sasha cried, rushing toward her, relief flooding through her. “I knew I’d find you!”

But as she drew closer, something stopped her. Lia’s posture was strange—rigid and unnatural, as though she were frozen in place. The air around her shimmered with cold magic, and the hair on the back of Sasha’s neck stood on end.

“Lia?” Sasha whispered, her voice shaking.

Slowly, Lia turned to face her, and Sasha gasped in horror.

Her face was pale—too pale—and her eyes were wide and blank, like dark, hollow voids. Her skin was ice-cold, and her clothes were stiff with frost, as though she had been standing there for hours. She looked like a shadow of the girl Sasha once knew.

“You shouldn’t have come,” Lia said, her voice low and distant, as though it were coming from somewhere far away.

Sasha stumbled back, her heart racing. “What… what happened to you?”

Lia’s expression twisted with sorrow. “The obelisk,” she whispered. “It’s alive.”

Before Sasha could respond, the ground beneath her began to tremble. The air grew even colder, and the obelisk started to glow brighter, pulsating with an icy light. A low, eerie sound filled the clearing, and Sasha’s heart pounded in her chest as she looked around, her mind racing.

Suddenly, dark, frozen figures began to emerge from the snow—pale, ghostly shapes that flickered in and out of existence, their faces twisted with sorrow and anger. They moved silently, their hollow eyes fixed on Sasha, and their skeletal hands reached out toward her.

“The obelisk has taken me,” Lia whispered. “And now it will take you.”

Tears filled Sasha’s eyes as she backed away, her heart breaking. She couldn’t leave Lia, but she couldn’t stay either. The Frozen Obelisk was alive, and it was hungry.

“Run,” Lia whispered, her voice trembling. “You have to go. Now.”

With a final, desperate look at her sister, Sasha turned and fled, her feet slipping on the icy ground as she raced through the blinding snow. The ghostly figures howled behind her, their voices echoing across the frozen plains, but she didn’t look back. She ran until the obelisk disappeared from sight, gasping for breath.

When Sasha finally reached the safety of the village, the frozen wilderness stood silent and dark in the distance, the obelisk still glowing faintly beneath the endless snow.

But Sasha knew the truth. The Frozen Obelisk had claimed Lia, just as it had claimed others before her. And though she had escaped, she knew the obelisk wasn’t done.

It was waiting, patient and eternal, for the next soul to be drawn into its frozen grip.
