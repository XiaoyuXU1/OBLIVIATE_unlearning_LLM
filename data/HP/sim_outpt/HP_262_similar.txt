In the city of Valdris, where the towers scraped the sky and the shadows of the past lingered on every cobblestone street, Aedric walked through the crowded marketplace with one goal in mind: finding the old storyteller. For weeks, Aedric had followed every rumor, every whispered tale of a man who knew of a hidden lineage—his lineage. Today, he was certain that his search had led him to the heart of the city, to this bustling place of merchants and thieves.

The streets were packed with stalls selling everything from exotic fruits to finely woven tapestries. Children ran through the crowds, laughing, while vendors shouted to passersby, trying to outdo each other. Aedric pushed past them, his cloak drawn tightly around him, eyes scanning every face he passed. He had spent years searching for the truth about his past, for any clue that could explain the mystery of his birth, and now he was close.

“You’ve never heard of him?” Aedric asked a merchant, holding up a piece of parchment with a crude drawing of an elderly man with a long, flowing beard. “They say he tells stories about the old kings, about forgotten bloodlines.”

The merchant squinted at the drawing and shook his head. “Never seen him. Try the east side of the market, near the fountain. That’s where all the wanderers and old folk gather.”

Aedric nodded his thanks and made his way through the throngs of people toward the fountain. His hand hovered over the hilt of the sword strapped to his side, a constant reminder of the danger that always seemed to follow him. His father had given him the blade, and with it, the promise that one day Aedric would understand his true destiny.

As he approached the fountain, a voice called out to him.

“You look lost, boy.”

Aedric turned to see an old man seated on the edge of the fountain, his beard as long and white as the one in Aedric’s drawing. His eyes twinkled with a knowledge that seemed older than time itself.

“I’ve been looking for you,” Aedric said, stepping closer. “They say you know the stories of the forgotten kings, of the bloodlines lost to history.”

The old man smiled faintly, his hands resting on a carved walking stick. “Stories, eh? Everyone’s looking for stories these days. But not all stories have happy endings.”

“I don’t care about endings,” Aedric replied. “I care about the truth. I need to know who I am.”

The old man’s eyes narrowed, studying Aedric for a long moment before nodding. “Very well, then. Sit. The truth, as you call it, is a dangerous thing. But if you’re sure you want it, I’ll tell you.”

Aedric sat on the edge of the fountain, the sound of the water gurgling behind him as the old man began to speak.

“Long ago, the land of Valdris was ruled by a line of kings who were said to be descended from the gods themselves. Their blood was powerful, their rule unquestioned. But as the years passed, their line grew thin, and enemies from the north sought to take their place. In the end, the last of the royal line disappeared, and the kingdom fell into chaos.”

Aedric leaned in, hanging on the old man’s every word. “But what happened to the heir? There must have been someone left.”

The old man smiled again, though this time there was something darker in it. “Ah, that’s the part the history books don’t tell. The heir was taken, hidden away by those who still believed in the old blood. They knew that one day, when the time was right, the heir would return to claim the throne.”

Aedric’s heart pounded in his chest. Could it be true? Could he be the heir the old man spoke of?

“Who was the heir?” he asked, his voice barely more than a whisper.

The old man’s eyes met his, and in that moment, Aedric felt a cold dread wash over him.

“You, boy,” the old man said softly. “You are the last of the royal bloodline.”

Aedric sat back, stunned. It couldn’t be. He had always suspected that his lineage was important, but this? The last of the forgotten kings? It was too much.

“How do you know?” Aedric asked, his voice shaky.

The old man reached into the folds of his cloak and pulled out a small, tarnished medallion. He held it out for Aedric to see. “This belonged to your father. It was given to me to keep safe until the day you came looking for the truth.”

Aedric took the medallion, turning it over in his hands. The symbol etched into the metal was one he had seen before, in old books and carvings—an emblem of the royal family of Valdris.

“You are the heir,” the old man repeated. “But there are those who would rather see the bloodline remain forgotten. They will come for you now, and they will stop at nothing to keep you from claiming your birthright.”

Aedric’s mind raced. He had spent his life searching for the truth, and now that he had it, he wasn’t sure what to do with it. He wasn’t a king—he was a wanderer, a fighter. How could he possibly take on the mantle of a ruler?

“What am I supposed to do?” Aedric asked, his voice trembling with uncertainty.

The old man stood, leaning on his staff. “You must decide, boy. You can walk away from this and live the life you’ve always known. Or you can embrace your destiny and fight for what is yours. But know this: once you choose the path of the king, there is no turning back.”

Aedric stared at the medallion in his hand, the weight of his decision pressing down on him. He had always felt that there was something more to his life, something greater waiting for him. But now that the truth was laid bare before him, the path ahead seemed more dangerous than ever.

“I’ll fight,” Aedric said at last, his voice firm. “I’ll claim what’s mine.”

The old man nodded, a glint of approval in his eyes. “Then the fight begins now.”

As Aedric stood, the sound of approaching footsteps reached his ears. He turned to see a group of cloaked figures moving toward them, their faces hidden in shadow, their intentions clear.

“The king’s enemies,” the old man whispered. “They’ve found you.”

Aedric drew his sword, his heart pounding in his chest. The truth had brought him here, and now there was no going back. He was the last heir of Valdris, and his fight for the throne had only just begun.
