The sun hung low in the sky as the sprawling city of Velaris stretched out beneath the towering Citadel, casting long shadows over the cobblestone streets. Velaris was a place of knowledge and learning, home to the greatest scholars and mages in the realm. But hidden deep within its labyrinthine libraries was a secret that few dared speak of—a prophecy so old and so dangerous that it had been buried beneath centuries of lies and forgotten histories. 

Ren had grown up in the Citadel, raised by scholars who had taken him in after his parents’ mysterious deaths. But despite the wealth of knowledge that surrounded him, Ren had always felt like an outsider, like something important had been kept from him. His only clue was a scrap of parchment left behind by his mother, containing a single line from the fabled "Shattered Prophecy": *The heir will rise when the stars bleed red.*

For years, Ren had tried to decipher its meaning, but every attempt led him back to the same question—what did it have to do with him? His parents had been researchers, nothing more, and yet this prophecy seemed to tie him to something much larger than he could comprehend. Now, as rumors of war and dark omens spread through the city, Ren knew it was time to find the truth.

“You’re not going through with this, are you?” Talia’s voice broke through Ren’s thoughts as she approached him in the dimly lit library. She was his oldest friend, a skilled mage who had helped him search for answers, though she had never believed in the prophecy’s power. Her eyes, sharp and worried, flickered toward the scrolls Ren had been pouring over.

“I don’t have a choice,” Ren replied, closing the dusty tome before him. “The prophecy... it’s about me. I can’t just ignore it.”

Talia crossed her arms, her expression skeptical. “You don’t know that for sure. The Shattered Prophecy is... well, it’s shattered. No one knows what it really means.”

Ren ran a hand through his hair, frustration gnawing at him. “I’ve spent my whole life trying to figure this out, Talia. I can’t just walk away now.”

Talia sighed, her gaze softening. “I get it, Ren. I really do. But prophecies are dangerous. They twist people, make them believe they’re destined for something, and then... they fall apart.”

Ren stood, pacing across the room, the weight of the parchment in his pocket feeling heavier with every step. “My parents were working on this when they disappeared. It’s all connected, Talia. I know it.”

Before she could argue further, a faint knock echoed through the room. A man dressed in the dark robes of the Citadel’s council stood in the doorway, his face drawn and pale.

“The council requests your presence, Ren,” the man said, his voice trembling slightly. “It’s urgent.”

Ren exchanged a glance with Talia before following the man out of the library. As they made their way through the winding halls of the Citadel, Ren’s heart pounded in his chest. The council rarely summoned him, and when they did, it was never good news.

They entered the council chamber, where a group of scholars sat around a massive table, their faces lined with worry. At the head of the table sat Archmage Lorian, the leader of the Citadel and the man who had taken Ren in after his parents' deaths. His sharp eyes fixed on Ren as he approached.

“Ren,” Lorian said, his voice grave. “We have received troubling news. It seems the prophecy you’ve been searching for... has begun to unfold.”

Ren’s blood ran cold. “What do you mean?”

Lorian gestured to a map spread across the table. “There have been sightings—strange phenomena. The stars over the northern regions have begun to change, taking on a red hue. It matches the description in the prophecy.”

Ren stepped closer, his heart racing as he scanned the map. “And what does this mean?”

Lorian’s expression darkened. “The prophecy speaks of an heir who will rise when the stars bleed red. If you truly believe you are tied to this, Ren, then we must act quickly. Forces are gathering in the north—dark forces. They seek to claim the power of the prophecy for themselves.”

Ren’s mind reeled. The prophecy was real. The stars had turned red, just as the ancient texts had foretold. But what did it mean for him? And what power were these dark forces seeking?

Talia stepped forward, her voice filled with concern. “What are you saying, Archmage? That Ren is supposed to... what? Save the world?”

Lorian’s gaze never left Ren’s. “That is what we must determine. But there is only one way to be sure. You must journey north, to the ruins of Mor Drayen—the place where the prophecy was first written.”

Ren swallowed hard. The ruins of Mor Drayen were said to be cursed, abandoned for centuries after a great calamity had struck. But if that was where the prophecy had originated, then perhaps it held the answers he had been searching for.

“I’ll go,” Ren said, his voice steady despite the fear churning inside him. “If this is my fate, then I have to see it through.”

Lorian nodded solemnly. “Very well. But know this, Ren—there are those who will stop at nothing to prevent the prophecy from being fulfilled. You will not be safe on this journey.”

Talia’s hand tightened on Ren’s arm. “I’m going with you.”

Ren turned to her, his expression softening. “Talia, you don’t have to—”

“Don’t even start,” she interrupted, her eyes fierce. “You’re not going into this alone.”

Ren gave her a grateful smile before turning back to the council. “We’ll leave at dawn.”

The journey to Mor Drayen was long and perilous, taking them through vast forests and over rugged mountains. As they traveled, the stars above seemed to burn brighter, their red glow casting an eerie light over the landscape. Every night, Ren felt the weight of the prophecy pressing down on him, the fear of what lay ahead gnawing at his resolve.

By the time they reached the ruins, the sky was a deep crimson, and the air hummed with a strange energy. The ruins of Mor Drayen were silent, the remnants of its once-great towers crumbling into the earth. At the center of the ruins stood a massive stone altar, its surface etched with the same symbols Ren had seen in the ancient scrolls.

“This is it,” Ren whispered, his heart racing. “This is where it all began.”

As they approached the altar, a sudden chill swept through the air, and the ground beneath them trembled. Talia drew her dagger, her eyes scanning the shadows.

“We’re not alone,” she said, her voice tense.

From the darkness, a figure emerged—a tall man clad in black armor, his face hidden beneath a hood. His eyes glowed with a malevolent light, and a wicked smile curled across his lips.

“So, the heir has finally arrived,” the man said, his voice dripping with malice. “But you are too late. The power of the prophecy belongs to me.”

Ren’s blood ran cold. “Who are you?”

The man laughed, his voice echoing through the ruins. “I am the one who will rewrite the prophecy. You were never meant to wield its power. You are nothing but a pawn.”

Before Ren could react, the man raised his hand, and the ground beneath them erupted in a burst of dark energy. Talia cried out as she was thrown to the ground, and Ren barely managed to keep his footing.

“You will not stop me,” the man snarled, his eyes blazing. “The prophecy is mine!”

Ren’s heart pounded in his chest as he faced the man. He had come all this way, searching for answers, only to find himself at the center of a battle for a power he barely understood. But he couldn’t back down now. The prophecy had chosen him for a reason.

With a surge of determination, Ren drew his sword and charged forward, ready to fight for the truth—and for his fate.
