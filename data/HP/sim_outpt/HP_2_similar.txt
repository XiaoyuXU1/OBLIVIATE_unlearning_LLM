On the eastern coast of Athelport, a small fishing village clung to the cliffs above the sea, its inhabitants living simple, quiet lives. The village had always depended on the ocean, and for generations, the tides had governed everything. The people of Athelport knew when to set sail, when to cast their nets, and when to retreat from the stormy waters.

But there was something strange about the tides in Athelport—something that the villagers rarely spoke about. At midnight, when the moon was high and the sea was calm, the tides would retreat far beyond the usual shoreline, exposing miles of seabed that should never have been revealed. It was said that strange things happened when the Midnight Tides came—things that defied explanation.

Leona Greaves had grown up hearing the stories. Her father, a fisherman, used to tell her tales of the Midnight Tides, how they revealed ancient, forgotten ruins beneath the sea, and how those who wandered too far into the exposed seabed often didn’t return. It was said that something lived out there, in the depths—something that waited for the tides to pull back so it could walk the earth again.

Leona had never believed in the old stories. She had always been practical, grounded in the real world. But everything changed the night her father disappeared.

It had been an ordinary night, the kind where the sea was calm, and the sky was clear. Her father had gone out fishing, as he always did, promising to return before the Midnight Tides. But he hadn’t come back. And when Leona went down to the shore to look for him, all she found was his boat, washed up on the rocks, empty.

The villagers had searched for him for days, but no trace of him was ever found. Some said the sea had claimed him, as it had claimed so many before. Others whispered that he had gone too far during the Midnight Tides and that whatever lived beneath the waves had taken him.

Leona refused to believe it. She couldn’t accept that her father was gone, not without a trace, not without a reason. And so, when the next Midnight Tides came, she decided to find the truth.

That night, as the moon rose high above the sea, Leona made her way down to the shore. The village was silent, the only sound the gentle lapping of the waves against the rocks. The tide was already pulling back, revealing the vast, barren seabed that stretched out into the darkness. It was eerie, seeing the ocean retreat so far, exposing the hidden world beneath.

Leona took a deep breath and stepped onto the wet sand, her boots sinking slightly as she walked. The air was thick with the smell of salt and seaweed, and a strange, almost electric tension hung in the air. She could feel it—something was out there, waiting.

The farther she walked, the more surreal the landscape became. Strange, jagged rocks jutted up from the seabed, and the remains of old shipwrecks lay scattered across the sand, their broken hulls half-buried. In the distance, she could see what looked like the crumbling ruins of an ancient structure, something far older than the village itself.

But it wasn’t the ruins that caught her attention. It was the light.

Far ahead, deep in the exposed seabed, a faint, bluish glow flickered in the darkness. It pulsed gently, like a heartbeat, beckoning her closer. Leona’s heart pounded in her chest, and despite the fear gnawing at her, she felt compelled to follow the light.

As she drew nearer, the glow intensified, and she realized that it was coming from a pool of water—a deep, unnatural pool that remained, even as the tides had pulled back. The water was perfectly still, its surface reflecting the light in strange, mesmerizing patterns.

Leona hesitated at the edge of the pool, peering into its depths. The light seemed to come from far below, as though something was glowing deep beneath the surface. And then, she saw it—a figure, moving slowly through the water, its form shifting and undulating in the light.

She gasped, stumbling back. For a moment, she thought it was her father—she could almost see his face, his silhouette, reaching out to her. But as the figure came closer, it became clear that it was not him. It wasn’t human at all.

The thing in the water was ancient, its form barely distinguishable, as though it was part of the ocean itself. Its eyes—if they were eyes—glowed faintly in the blue light, and its long, tendril-like limbs swayed gently with the current. It moved slowly, deliberately, and as it rose toward the surface, Leona felt an overwhelming sense of dread.

"Leave," a voice whispered, though it didn’t come from the creature. It echoed in her mind, soft but insistent. "This place is not for you."

Leona stepped back, her heart racing. But she couldn’t leave. Not yet. "What happened to my father?" she called out, her voice trembling. "Where is he?"

For a moment, the creature paused, its glowing eyes fixed on her. And then, in a voice that was barely more than a whisper, it spoke.

"He went too far," it said, the words echoing in the stillness of the night. "He sought what should remain hidden. Now, he belongs to the deep."

Leona’s breath caught in her throat as the truth sank in. Her father had gone beyond the limits, beyond where the tides allowed, and he had paid the price.

"Can I bring him back?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

The creature didn’t answer. Instead, it began to sink back into the pool, the light fading as it disappeared into the depths.

"Wait!" Leona cried, stepping closer to the edge. "Please! I need to know!"

But the light was gone, and the pool was once again dark and still.

Desperation surged through her, and before she could think twice, she plunged her hand into the water. It was cold, impossibly cold, and as she reached deeper, her fingers brushed against something solid—something that pulsed with the same eerie light she had seen before.

A sudden, sharp pain shot through her arm, and she yanked it back, gasping. Her hand was glowing faintly, the blue light dancing across her skin. And then, as quickly as it had appeared, the light faded, leaving only a dull ache behind.

Leona stumbled back from the pool, her heart racing. She had come for answers, but all she had found were more questions.

As she turned to leave, the sound of the tide returning echoed through the night, the waves rushing back to fill the exposed seabed. The Midnight Tides were over.

But as Leona made her way back to the shore, she knew that she had crossed a line. She had seen what lay beneath the surface, and it had marked her. The tides would come again, and when they did, they would come for her.

The sea never forgot.
