In the kingdom of **Vandryn**, the **Oracles of Aeloria** were once revered as the most powerful seers in the land, able to glimpse the future and guide kings and queens with their prophetic visions. But a century ago, the **Shroud**, a mysterious magical barrier, descended over the land, cutting Vandryn off from the rest of the world and severing the Oracles’ connection to their source of power. Without their visions, the Oracles fell into obscurity, and their ancient temple was abandoned. Over time, the kingdom descended into chaos, and the once-great dynasty that ruled Vandryn fractured into warring factions.

The story follows **Sera Valen**, a seventeen-year-old girl who grew up in the isolated village of **Shadowmere**, far from the politics and power struggles of Vandryn’s ruling families. Sera has always felt different from the other villagers—she is plagued by strange dreams and visions that she doesn’t understand, and she often sees glimpses of a future that never comes to pass. When a mysterious stranger named **Kael Morven** arrives in Shadowmere, claiming to be a former Oracle, he tells Sera the truth: she is the last living descendant of the **Oracle of Aeloria**, and her bloodline holds the key to restoring the lost magic of the Oracles.

Kael reveals that the Shroud was not a natural phenomenon—it was created by the **Ebon Court**, a secretive group of dark sorcerers who sought to control the Oracles’ power and bend the future to their will. The Ebon Court succeeded in trapping Vandryn within the Shroud, but their control over the kingdom has weakened in recent years. Now, the Court is seeking to restore their dominance, and they are hunting down anyone with the blood of the Oracles.

With the Ebon Court closing in, Sera is forced to flee her village and embark on a journey to the **Temple of Aeloria**, the long-abandoned sanctuary of the Oracles, where she hopes to unlock the secrets of her heritage. She is joined by Kael, who has his own reasons for wanting to restore the Oracles’ magic, and **Elias Dorne**, a former soldier who is searching for redemption after his family was killed in a war between the rival factions of Vandryn’s nobility.

As Sera travels across the kingdom, she begins to unlock her powers, but she also learns that the visions she sees are not always clear or accurate. The future is constantly shifting, and every choice she makes has the potential to change the course of events. Sera must learn to trust her instincts and navigate the murky waters of prophecy, all while evading the agents of the Ebon Court, who are determined to stop her before she can fulfill her destiny.

As they journey deeper into the heart of Vandryn, Sera and her companions encounter various factions vying for control of the kingdom, each with their own agenda. The once-great city of **Ironcliff** is now a battleground, torn apart by civil war, and the royal family has all but disintegrated. Sera learns that her visions of the future may be the key to uniting the fractured kingdom, but she is also faced with difficult choices—each faction wants to use her power for their own gain, and not everyone can be trusted.

Along the way, Sera begins to experience strange and disturbing visions of the **Shadowborn**, ancient creatures of darkness that were once believed to be myths. The Shadowborn are tied to the Shroud, and their return signals that the barrier between the mortal world and the shadow realm is weakening. Sera must find a way to stop the Shadowborn from breaking through, but doing so will require her to confront the Ebon Court and the truth about her own connection to the Shroud.

The climax of the novel takes place at the **Temple of Aeloria**, where Sera finally confronts the leader of the Ebon Court, **Lord Valak**, a powerful sorcerer who seeks to use her bloodline to shatter the Shroud and unleash the Shadowborn upon the world. In a final battle for control of the future, Sera must decide whether to embrace her power as the last Oracle and seal the Shroud forever, or to destroy it and risk unleashing forces that could consume the kingdom.

*The Last Oracle* is a story of destiny, choice, and the struggle to control the future. Set in a kingdom on the brink of collapse, the novel explores themes of prophecy, power, and the consequences of trying to shape the future. At approximately 160,000 words, it offers a richly woven narrative filled with political intrigue, magical battles, and a protagonist who must navigate the shifting sands of fate to save her kingdom and uncover her true purpose.
