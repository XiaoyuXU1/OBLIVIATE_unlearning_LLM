Ravenhill Academy was known for one thing: its reputation for taking in troubled boys and molding them into model citizens. From the outside, it looked like any prestigious boarding school, with its grand stone buildings and immaculate lawns, but beneath its facade lay something much darker. The school was perched on the edge of the **Greycliff Forest**, a place filled with whispered legends and ghost stories passed down through generations. Students who misbehaved were sent into the forest for punishment, a practice meant to instill fear and obedience. The trouble was, some of those students never came back.

**Jake**, seventeen and rebellious, was sent to Ravenhill after being expelled from his third school in as many years. His parents were at their wits’ end, and Ravenhill was their last hope for him. Jake didn’t care. The thought of being locked up in a stuffy old boarding school only made him more determined to resist authority.

From the moment he arrived, Jake could tell something was off. The teachers were strict, emotionless, and the other students seemed scared, constantly glancing over their shoulders as though waiting for something—or someone. Jake noticed that in the dining hall, there were always empty seats, and sometimes those seats were never filled again. When he asked about it, his classmates just shrugged and told him to keep quiet. But Jake couldn’t keep quiet.

On his first night, Jake’s roommate, **Liam**, gave him a warning. "Stay out of the forest," Liam said, his face pale and drawn. "That’s where the Forgotten Ones are."

"The what?" Jake scoffed, thinking it was just another ghost story. But Liam’s expression didn’t change. "The students who disappeared," he whispered. "They were taken by the Forgotten Ones. They say once you enter Greycliff Forest, you never come back the same. If you come back at all."

Jake didn’t believe in ghost stories, and he wasn’t about to let some creepy forest scare him into following the rules. But over the next few weeks, he began to notice strange things happening. At night, he would hear the wind howling through the trees, but mixed in with it were voices—faint, distant cries for help. He would wake up drenched in sweat, the feeling of being watched creeping over him. The other boys looked more and more haunted as the days went on, their faces pale and their eyes hollow.

One afternoon, after Jake got into yet another fight with a teacher, he was sent to detention. But this wasn’t the usual detention in the study hall or the gym. He was sent into the woods.

The headmaster, **Mr. Craven**, handed Jake a flashlight and pointed to the forest edge. "You’re to spend the night in the old watchtower," he said, his voice flat. "You’ll find it about two miles into the forest. It’s a chance for you to reflect on your behavior." His words were cold, and Jake didn’t miss the smirk that played across the headmaster’s lips as he turned away.

Jake had no choice but to obey. As he entered the forest, the trees seemed to close in around him, their branches twisted and gnarled like skeletal hands. The path to the watchtower was overgrown, barely visible in the fading light. With each step, the forest seemed to grow darker, the air colder. The wind rustled through the leaves, but there was something else—a soft, low whispering that seemed to follow him.

By the time Jake reached the watchtower, night had fallen, and the forest was alive with strange sounds. The watchtower itself was ancient, its wooden beams creaking and groaning as though it could collapse at any moment. Jake climbed the rickety stairs to the top, where he found a small room with a single dusty chair and a broken window overlooking the forest.

He sat there in the dark, staring out at the sea of trees, waiting for the hours to pass. But as the night wore on, the whispers grew louder. They were closer now, surrounding the tower. Jake tried to convince himself it was just the wind, but deep down, he knew it wasn’t.

Suddenly, the temperature dropped, and a thick mist began to roll in from the forest floor, swirling around the base of the watchtower. From the mist, figures began to emerge—shadowy, indistinct shapes that moved silently through the trees. Jake’s heart raced as he realized they were coming toward him. He scrambled to his feet, but there was nowhere to run. The stairs creaked under the weight of unseen footsteps, and the door to the room slammed shut.

The whispers were all around him now, and in the dim light, Jake could see their faces—pale, hollow-eyed, their mouths moving in silent pleas. These were the Forgotten Ones. The students who had disappeared into the forest, never to return.

"Help us," one of them whispered, reaching out a skeletal hand. "They took us."

"Who took you?" Jake stammered, backing away until his back was pressed against the cold stone wall.

"The Masters," the figure hissed. "The ones who control the school. They feed on us, on our fear. And now… they want you."

Panic surged through Jake as the Forgotten Ones closed in around him, their ghostly forms reaching out, trying to pull him into their world. He had to get out, had to escape before he became one of them. With a surge of adrenaline, Jake threw open the window and climbed out onto the narrow ledge. Below him, the mist swirled like a living thing, and the whispers filled the air, but Jake wasn’t about to give up.

He jumped, landing hard on the forest floor, pain shooting through his legs. But there was no time to rest. The Forgotten Ones were still coming, their forms moving through the mist like shadows. Jake ran, stumbling through the trees, branches clawing at his clothes, the whispers following him, growing louder with every step.

By the time he broke free of the forest, dawn was breaking over the horizon, casting a pale light over the school grounds. Jake collapsed on the lawn, gasping for breath, his heart pounding in his chest. He had escaped the Forgotten Ones, but he knew he wasn’t safe. Not yet.

When he returned to the school, no one said a word. The headmaster smirked, but there was something darker in his eyes—something that told Jake the headmaster knew exactly what had happened in the forest. The other boys avoided him, their eyes filled with fear and pity. 

That night, Jake packed his things. He wasn’t going to wait for the Masters to come for him. As he walked away from Ravenhill Academy, he glanced back at the looming buildings, at the edge of the forest where the shadows still lingered, and he knew the Forgotten Ones were still there, waiting for their next victim.

But Jake wouldn’t be one of them. Not if he could help it.

As the gates of Ravenhill closed behind him, Jake made a promise to himself: he would uncover the truth about the school and the Masters, and he would make sure no one else ever disappeared into the darkness again.
