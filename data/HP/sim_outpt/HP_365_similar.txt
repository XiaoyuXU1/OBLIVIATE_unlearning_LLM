Under the dim glow of the crescent moon, Arlen and Lora made their way through the narrow, winding streets of Serinthal. The once-grand city had been swallowed by time, its proud towers crumbled into heaps of stone and its vast libraries now little more than forgotten ashes. Few dared to venture into its ruins, and for good reason. The darkness that lingered here was palpable, like a heavy mist that clung to the skin and seeped into the bones. But Arlen knew they had no choice. The answers they sought lay deep within this forsaken place.

“We shouldn’t be here,” Lora whispered, her voice tight with apprehension. “This city was abandoned for a reason.”

Arlen glanced at her, his brow furrowed. “I know, but we’re out of options. The Veil of Shadows was last seen here, and if we don’t find it before it falls into the wrong hands, the entire kingdom is doomed.”

Lora shivered, pulling her cloak tighter around her shoulders. “I just don’t understand why the Council didn’t tell us about this sooner. Why keep something so important a secret?”

“Power,” Arlen replied grimly. “That’s all it ever comes down to. They’ve been hiding the truth for centuries, keeping dangerous knowledge locked away so no one could challenge their authority.”

A sudden gust of wind howled through the ruins, stirring the debris at their feet and making the shadows seem to writhe with life. Lora instinctively reached for the small crystal pendant she wore around her neck, a charm of protection she’d crafted herself. Arlen’s keen eyes scanned the crumbling walls around them, watching for any sign of movement. The air here was thick with the remnants of dark magic, and he knew they weren’t alone.

As they rounded a corner, the towering remains of Serinthal’s central library came into view. Its massive double doors, once made of gleaming oak, now hung crookedly on rusted hinges. Time had not been kind to this place. The knowledge within had been lost, the scrolls and tomes scattered and destroyed when the city fell to ruin.

But Arlen knew there had to be something left—something that would lead them to the Veil.

“We need to get inside,” Arlen said, stepping forward and pushing one of the doors. It groaned loudly, resisting at first, before finally giving way and opening just wide enough for them to slip through. Lora followed, her footsteps hesitant.

The interior of the library was just as desolate as the exterior. Shelves lay in splinters on the ground, and the few remaining books were so decayed that they turned to dust at the slightest touch. But Arlen wasn’t interested in the books. He had learned from his research that the Veil had been hidden in a vault beneath the library, a vault that could only be accessed by solving the riddle left behind by the city's last guardians.

Lora knelt beside one of the ruined shelves, her hands brushing over the ancient carvings that adorned the walls. “Do you think the riddle is still intact?” she asked softly, her voice barely audible in the eerie silence of the library.

Arlen nodded. “It has to be. The guardians were too careful to let something like that be destroyed by time.”

He moved to the far side of the room, where a large stone mural covered the wall. The mural depicted scenes of Serinthal’s past glory—mages in flowing robes, wielding their powers to shape the city, and the Council of Light standing triumphant over the forces of darkness. But at the center of the mural was what Arlen had been searching for: a hidden inscription, written in the ancient language of the Old Kingdoms.

“It’s here,” he breathed, tracing his fingers over the delicate script. “The riddle.”

Lora stood beside him, squinting at the inscription. “Can you read it?”

Arlen nodded slowly. “It’s an old dialect, but I think I can manage.” He cleared his throat, reading the words aloud:

"To those who seek what must not be found,  
A choice awaits, in silence bound.  
One path leads to endless light,  
The other swallows all in night.  
Decide with care, and speak your choice,  
For fate shall answer with but one voice."

Lora frowned, her brow furrowing in confusion. “What does it mean?”

“It’s a riddle,” Arlen said, stepping back to study the mural as a whole. “We have to make a choice. One path leads to the Veil, and the other… something worse.”

“Something worse?” Lora repeated, her voice laced with unease. “Like what?”

Arlen didn’t answer immediately. His eyes were fixed on the mural, on the images of light and shadow intertwining at the heart of the city’s downfall. “I’m not sure,” he admitted. “But we don’t have much time. If we don’t find the Veil soon, the Council will send someone else. Someone who won’t hesitate to use it.”

Lora bit her lip, her hand absently gripping the crystal at her throat. “And if we choose the wrong path?”

Arlen’s expression darkened. “Then the darkness will consume us both.”

For a long moment, neither of them spoke. The weight of the decision hung heavily in the air between them. Finally, Lora took a deep breath and stepped forward. “We have to try,” she said quietly. “We can’t let the Veil fall into the wrong hands.”

Arlen nodded, his resolve hardening. “Agreed.”

Together, they approached the center of the mural, where a small pedestal stood, worn smooth by time. In its center was a single stone orb, glowing faintly in the dim light. Arlen reached out, his hand hovering just above the surface of the orb.

“What now?” Lora asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Arlen’s gaze never left the orb. “We make our choice.”

Taking a deep breath, Arlen placed his hand on the orb. The moment his fingers touched the stone, the ground beneath them began to tremble. The mural shifted, the images of light and shadow swirling together in a vortex of magic. Arlen felt a sudden rush of power, a force pulling him toward the pedestal as the ancient magic responded to his touch.

The choice was his.

Arlen closed his eyes, focusing on the riddle. One path leads to endless light, the other swallows all in night. He had to be sure. He had to choose wisely.

“Light,” he whispered, his voice steady. “I choose the path of light.”

For a moment, nothing happened. Then, with a sudden jolt, the ground beneath them split open, revealing a staircase that descended into the darkness below. Arlen exhaled in relief, stepping back from the pedestal as the tremors subsided.

“We did it,” Lora said, her voice filled with awe.

But Arlen wasn’t so sure. As he stared into the darkness of the stairwell, a deep sense of foreboding crept over him. Something was wrong. The air here was too still, too quiet. And in the back of his mind, he couldn’t shake the feeling that they had just made a terrible mistake.

“We need to be careful,” he said, his voice low. “This isn’t over yet.”

Lora nodded, her expression tense. Together, they descended the stairs, the weight of the darkness pressing in on them from all sides. The deeper they went, the colder the air became, until their breath hung in the air like mist.

At the bottom of the stairs, they found themselves in a vast underground chamber. In the center of the room, surrounded by a circle of glowing runes, stood the Veil of Shadows.

It was smaller than Arlen had imagined, no larger than a pendant, its surface smooth and black as night. But the power radiating from it was unmistakable. It pulsed with a dark energy, so intense that Arlen could feel it in his very soul.

“We found it,” Lora whispered, her eyes wide with both fear and awe.

But Arlen couldn’t move. His gaze was locked on the Veil, his mind racing with doubt. Was this really the path of light? Or had they just unleashed something far darker than they could ever imagine?

Before he could answer, a voice echoed through the chamber, cold and menacing.

“You’ve made your choice, Arlen. Now, face the consequences.”

The shadows around them began to move, and the darkness stirred to life.
