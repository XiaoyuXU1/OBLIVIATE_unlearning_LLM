Nestled in the heart of the Silver Valley, the town of Avenbrook thrived along the banks of the shimmering Silver River. The river was the town’s lifeblood, providing fresh water, abundant fish, and fertile soil for the villagers’ crops. Its surface gleamed with a soft, silvery light, even at night, giving the town its name and filling it with a sense of wonder.

But beneath its beauty, the Silver River held a dark secret—one that had been whispered about for generations. There were stories of people disappearing near the river, taken by the current, never to be seen again. Some said it was the river itself, alive and hungry, that claimed them. Others believed that something far more sinister lay beneath its waters.

Aelia, a young woman who had spent her entire life in Avenbrook, didn’t believe the stories. The river was her solace, her escape from the mundanity of daily life. Every evening, she would walk along its banks, her bare feet brushing against the cool grass, and watch as the moonlight danced across the water.

But everything changed one summer night, when her younger sister, Lila, vanished without a trace.

Lila had always been fascinated by the river, more so than anyone else in the village. She would spend hours playing by the water’s edge, her laughter filling the air as she skipped stones across the surface. But that night, she had gone out to the river alone and never returned. Search parties scoured the banks, but there was no sign of her—no footprints, no belongings, nothing.

The villagers whispered that the river had taken her, just as it had taken others before. But Aelia refused to believe it. Lila was too strong, too smart to be claimed by something as simple as water. There had to be another explanation.

Driven by desperation, Aelia decided to go to the river herself, determined to find out what had happened to her sister. The moon was full that night, casting a pale glow over the valley as she made her way to the riverbank. The water was calm, its surface smooth and reflective, as though nothing had ever disturbed it.

But as Aelia stood there, staring into the water, she noticed something strange. A faint light shimmered just beneath the surface, almost like a reflection, but it was too deep to be caused by the moon. It pulsed softly, drawing her closer.

Without thinking, Aelia stepped into the water. It was cold—much colder than she expected—and the chill seeped into her bones as she waded deeper. The light grew brighter, and soon, she was waist-deep, the river’s current pulling gently at her legs.

And then she heard it—a voice, soft and melodic, coming from beneath the water.

“Aelia…”

Her heart leaped into her throat. It was Lila’s voice.

“Lila?” she called, her voice trembling. “Lila, where are you?”

The water rippled, and for a brief moment, Aelia saw her sister’s face, just below the surface. Lila’s eyes were wide, and her mouth moved as though she was speaking, but the words were muffled by the water. Without thinking, Aelia plunged her hands into the river, reaching for her sister.

But the moment her fingers touched the surface, the light vanished, and Lila’s face disappeared.

Panic surged through Aelia as she pulled back, gasping for breath. The river was calm once more, its surface unbroken, as though nothing had happened. But Aelia had seen her—she knew she had. Lila was down there, somewhere, trapped beneath the water.

Determined to find her, Aelia waded deeper, the water now up to her chest. The current grew stronger, pulling her toward the center of the river, but she didn’t stop. She couldn’t stop. Lila needed her.

As she reached the deepest part of the river, the water began to churn. The light reappeared, brighter than before, and with it came the voice again.

“Aelia… come to me…”

This time, there was no mistaking it. The voice was not her sister’s. It was something else—something older, something dangerous.

Before Aelia could react, the water surged around her, pulling her under. She fought to stay afloat, her arms thrashing as the current dragged her down, deeper and deeper into the river’s depths. The light surrounded her now, blinding her, and the voice grew louder, filling her ears with its strange, hypnotic melody.

“Aelia… you’ve come so far… just a little farther…”

The pressure in her chest grew unbearable as the water pressed in around her. Her vision blurred, and for a moment, she thought she saw figures moving in the depths—shadowy forms drifting just beyond her reach. They seemed to beckon to her, their movements slow and deliberate, like they were waiting for her to join them.

Just as her lungs were about to give out, a hand grabbed her wrist, pulling her upward with a force she couldn’t resist. The light faded, and the voice became a distant hum as Aelia was dragged back to the surface. Gasping for air, she broke through the water, coughing and spluttering as she clung to the shore.

When she finally regained her breath, she looked up to see an old woman standing on the bank, her eyes filled with both anger and fear.

“You fool,” the woman hissed, kneeling beside Aelia. “Do you have any idea what you’ve done?”

Aelia stared at her, too weak to respond. The woman’s face was lined with age, her skin as weathered as the stones that lined the riverbank, but her eyes were sharp and clear.

“They’ve had a taste of you now,” the woman said, her voice low and urgent. “The river’s spirits. They’re ancient, and they don’t let go easily.”

Aelia shook her head, still trying to make sense of what had happened. “My sister… Lila… she’s down there. I saw her.”

The old woman’s expression softened, but only for a moment. “What you saw wasn’t your sister, child. The river shows you what you want to see. It tempts you, pulls you in, and once you’re beneath its surface, it never lets you go.”

Aelia’s heart sank as the realization hit her. The river had tricked her, just as it had tricked Lila. And now, she was marked by it, bound to its ancient power.

“You must leave,” the woman continued, standing up and gesturing toward the village. “Get as far from this place as you can. The river won’t forget you, but if you stay away, you might have a chance.”

But Aelia couldn’t leave. Not without her sister.

“I can’t go,” she said, her voice barely a whisper. “Lila’s still down there. I have to save her.”

The old woman shook her head, her eyes filled with sorrow. “Some things can’t be saved, child. The river takes what it wants. And once it has you, there’s no going back.”

As the woman turned and disappeared into the night, Aelia stared out at the river, its surface once again calm and peaceful. But she knew the truth now.

The Silver River was alive. It was ancient, powerful, and hungry. And it would never stop calling.
