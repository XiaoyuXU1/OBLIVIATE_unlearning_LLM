On the desolate cliffs of Ravenmoor, overlooking the stormy sea, stood the ancient Watchtower of Thorne. The tower had been abandoned for centuries, a crumbling relic of a time long past, its stone walls weathered by wind and rain. But despite its decay, the Watchtower still loomed over the land like a silent sentinel, and the people of Ravenmoor spoke of it only in whispers.

There were stories—stories of strange lights flickering in the tower’s windows at night, of voices carried on the wind, calling out from the darkness. The elders warned the younger generation never to go near it, claiming that the tower was cursed. It was said to be haunted by the souls of those who had once guarded the cliffs, trapped there by some ancient, forgotten magic.

Alaric had never believed in the stories. Growing up in Ravenmoor, he had often wandered the cliffs, exploring the rocky shorelines and the forgotten ruins scattered across the land. But the Watchtower had always been off-limits. His father, the village blacksmith, had warned him never to go near it, and Alaric had listened—until now.

One stormy night, Alaric’s younger sister, Elara, disappeared.

She had gone out to gather herbs before the storm hit, and when she didn’t return, the village had searched for her. But there was no trace of her, only her basket, lying abandoned near the base of the cliffs. The villagers feared the worst—they believed that the Watchtower had claimed her, just as it had claimed others before.

Alaric refused to accept it. He couldn’t believe that his sister was gone, that the tower had somehow taken her. Desperate to find her, he decided to do what no one in the village had dared to do for generations: he would enter the Watchtower.

The storm raged as Alaric made his way across the cliffs, the wind howling and the rain lashing against his face. The sea crashed against the rocks far below, sending sprays of icy water into the air. But he pressed on, his heart pounding with fear and determination.

As he reached the base of the Watchtower, Alaric paused, staring up at the dark, crumbling structure. The tower seemed to loom even larger up close, its windows dark and empty, like hollow eyes. The air around it was thick with an unnatural cold, and for a moment, Alaric felt a strange sense of dread.

But then he heard it—a faint, distant voice, carried on the wind.

"Alaric…"

His heart skipped a beat. It was Elara’s voice.

Without hesitation, Alaric pushed open the heavy wooden door of the tower and stepped inside. The air was damp and musty, and the only light came from the occasional flicker of lightning through the windows. The stone walls were covered in moss, and the floor was littered with debris from years of abandonment.

"Elara?" Alaric called, his voice echoing off the walls. "Where are you?"

The voice came again, closer this time. "Alaric… help me…"

His breath quickened as he made his way up the narrow, winding staircase that led to the top of the tower. The steps were uneven, and the wind howled through the cracks in the stone, making it feel as though the tower itself was alive, groaning and creaking with each gust of wind.

Finally, Alaric reached the top. The chamber at the peak of the tower was circular, with large windows on all sides, offering a view of the stormy sea far below. But it wasn’t the view that caught his attention. It was the figure standing in the center of the room.

It was Elara.

Relief flooded through Alaric as he ran toward her, his heart pounding with hope. "Elara! I knew I’d find you!"

But as he drew closer, something stopped him. Elara was standing perfectly still, her back to him, her hair hanging limp and wet from the rain. There was something off about her posture, something unnatural. Alaric’s breath caught in his throat as he hesitated, his mind racing.

"Elara?" he whispered, his voice trembling.

Slowly, she turned to face him, and Alaric’s blood ran cold.

Her eyes were empty, hollow, like dark voids that swallowed the light. Her skin was pale, almost translucent, and her lips were tinged with blue. She wasn’t his sister anymore—not entirely.

"Alaric…" she whispered, her voice faint and echoing. "You shouldn’t have come."

Alaric stumbled back, his heart racing with fear. "What… what happened to you?"

Elara’s expression remained blank, her eyes fixed on him with an eerie calm. "The Watchtower… it keeps us here. It’s too late for me."

"No!" Alaric cried, shaking his head. "I’m going to get you out of here. We’re going home."

But Elara only shook her head, her voice barely above a whisper. "You can’t. No one leaves the tower once it has claimed them."

Before Alaric could respond, the air around them grew colder, and the shadows in the room seemed to shift and move. The wind howled louder, and the tower groaned, as if it were alive. Alaric’s breath came in short, panicked gasps as he backed away, his eyes darting around the room.

The shadows—there was something in them. Dark figures, barely visible, moving just beyond the edge of his vision. They whispered, their voices blending with the wind, filling the room with an eerie chorus of murmurs.

"Alaric…" the voices called. "Stay with us…"

Panic surged through him as he grabbed Elara’s hand, pulling her toward the staircase. "We have to go!" he shouted over the wind.

But Elara didn’t move. Her hand was cold, unresponsive, as if she were already gone. "I can’t leave," she whispered. "The tower won’t let me."

Alaric’s heart pounded in his chest as he looked into his sister’s empty eyes. He couldn’t leave her behind. He wouldn’t.

"Then I’ll stay with you," he said, his voice trembling. "I won’t leave you."

For a moment, Elara’s expression softened, and Alaric thought he saw a flicker of the sister he had known. But then the shadows surged forward, wrapping around them both like a suffocating blanket. The room spun, and Alaric’s vision blurred as the darkness closed in.

The last thing he heard before everything went black was the sound of the tower, groaning and whispering in the wind.

When Alaric awoke, he was lying on the rocky cliffs outside the Watchtower. The storm had passed, and the first light of dawn was beginning to break over the horizon. He sat up, gasping for breath, his mind reeling with confusion.

Elara was gone.

The Watchtower stood silent and still behind him, its dark windows reflecting the pale morning light. Alaric’s heart ached with the weight of what had happened. The tower had taken his sister, just as it had taken so many others before her.

But as Alaric stared up at the crumbling structure, he knew that he couldn’t stay. The Watchtower had claimed Elara, and it would claim him too if he stayed any longer. With a heavy heart, he turned and made his way back toward the village, leaving the tower—and his sister—behind.

But he knew that the Watchtower wasn’t done. It would wait, patient and silent, until the next soul came searching for answers.

And the next time, it wouldn’t let go.
