In the small town of Greystone, nestled between the rolling hills and thick forests, there stood the ruins of an ancient manor that had long since burned to the ground. The townspeople avoided the place, for it was said to be cursed, haunted by the spirits of those who had perished in the flames. The ruins were little more than charred stone and ash, but on certain nights, when the wind blew just right, the villagers claimed they could hear whispers coming from the ashes—voices that called to anyone who dared to listen.

Iris had always been intrigued by the stories of the old manor. Her grandmother used to tell her tales of the grand house that once stood at the edge of town, of the strange family that had lived there, and of the fire that had destroyed it all in one terrible night. The fire had taken everything—except, some said, the spirits of those who had lived there.

But to Iris, the stories were nothing more than that—stories. She had grown up in Greystone and had often wandered near the ruins, finding them more curious than frightening. That all changed the night her younger brother, Evan, disappeared.

It had been a chilly autumn evening, with the wind howling through the trees and the sky darkening with storm clouds. Evan had gone to the edge of town to play with some friends, but when night fell, only his friends returned. They claimed they had been near the old ruins when they heard strange whispers calling out to them, and Evan had gone to investigate. They had waited for him, but he never came back.

The villagers whispered that the ruins had taken him, that the spirits had claimed another soul. But Iris refused to believe it. Determined to find her brother, she set out for the ruins alone, despite the warnings from her family and the townspeople.

As she approached the charred remains of the manor, the air grew colder, and the wind seemed to carry with it a strange, eerie sound—like faint voices, whispering just beyond her hearing. The ruins loomed ahead, dark and silent, their stone walls blackened by the fire that had destroyed them. The ground was covered in ash, and the air smelled of smoke, even though the fire had long since died out.

“Evan?” Iris called, her voice trembling as it echoed through the empty ruins.

There was no answer, only the soft rustling of the wind.

As she stepped deeper into the ruins, the air seemed to grow heavier, the whispers growing louder in her ears. The charred walls loomed around her, casting long shadows in the fading light. Her heart pounded in her chest, but she pressed on, determined to find her brother.

Suddenly, she heard it—a faint, distant voice, carried on the wind.

“Iris…”

Her breath caught in her throat. It was Evan’s voice.

Without thinking, she ran toward the sound, her feet slipping on the ash-covered ground. The ruins twisted and turned like a maze, the once grand hallways now nothing more than broken stone and rubble. But she didn’t stop. She had to find him.

“Evan!” she called again, her voice trembling. “Where are you?”

The voice came again, closer this time. “Iris… help me…”

She rounded a corner and found herself standing in what had once been the great hall of the manor. The walls were crumbling, and the ceiling had long since collapsed, leaving the room open to the darkening sky. And there, standing in the center of the room, was Evan.

He stood perfectly still, his back to her, his small figure barely visible in the dim light.

“Evan!” Iris cried, rushing toward him, relief flooding through her. “I knew I’d find you!”

But as she drew closer, something stopped her. Evan’s posture was strange—rigid and unnatural, as though he were frozen in place. The whispers grew louder, filling the air around her, and the hair on the back of Iris’s neck stood on end.

“Evan?” she whispered, her voice shaking.

Slowly, Evan turned to face her, and Iris gasped in horror.

His face was pale—too pale—and his eyes were wide and blank, like dark, hollow voids. His clothes were singed and covered in ash, and his skin looked almost translucent, as though he had been touched by the fire that had destroyed the manor.

“You shouldn’t have come,” he said, his voice low and distant, as though it were coming from somewhere far away.

Iris stumbled back, her heart racing. “What… what happened to you?”

Evan’s expression twisted with sorrow. “The fire… it’s still here.”

Before Iris could respond, the ground beneath her began to tremble. The air grew colder, and the ruins around her seemed to come alive, the shadows twisting and writhing like smoke. The whispers grew louder, more insistent, and the scent of burning filled the air.

Suddenly, dark figures began to emerge from the shadows—pale, ghostly shapes that flickered in and out of existence, their faces twisted with anger and sorrow. They moved silently, their eyes glowing faintly in the darkness, and their skeletal hands reached out toward Iris.

“The fire never died,” Evan whispered. “And now it will take you too.”

Iris’s breath came in short, panicked gasps as the figures drew closer, their ghostly forms closing in around her. She wanted to run, but her legs felt heavy, rooted to the ground. The air grew thicker, suffocating her, and the whispers filled her ears, urging her to stay.

Evan stepped forward, his eyes filled with sorrow. “You have to go,” he whispered. “It’s too late for me.”

Tears filled Iris’s eyes as she backed away, her heart breaking. “I can’t leave you,” she cried. “I won’t.”

Evan’s face twisted with pain. “The fire… it’s taken me. Please, Iris. Run.”

The ghostly figures surged forward, their hands reaching for her, but Iris tore herself free from the heavy air and turned, fleeing through the ruins as fast as she could. The whispers howled behind her, their voices echoing through the night, but she didn’t look back. She ran until she reached the edge of the ruins, gasping for breath.

When Iris finally reached the safety of the town, the first light of dawn was breaking over the hills. The ruins stood dark and silent in the distance, their blackened walls casting long shadows over the landscape.

But Iris knew the truth. The fire had never truly died, and the ruins had claimed Evan, just as they had claimed others before him. And though she had escaped, she knew that the fire would burn again.

It was waiting, buried in the ashes, until the next soul ventured too close.
