In the small village of Dark Hollow, hidden deep within a forested valley, there stood an ancient well at the edge of the woods. The Forgotten Well, as the villagers called it, was said to be cursed. No one knew who had built the well or why, but for generations, the villagers had avoided it, fearing the strange stories that surrounded it. It was said that the well had no bottom, that it led to a dark, otherworldly place, and that those who heard the whispers coming from its depths were never seen again.

Mira had grown up hearing the stories of the Forgotten Well. Her grandfather had told her tales of the well’s dark history, of the people who had vanished without a trace after wandering too close to its edge. Her father had always warned her to stay away from the well, to never listen to the whispers. But Mira had always been curious, wondering what really lay at the bottom of the ancient, moss-covered structure.

One quiet evening, just as the sun was setting behind the trees, her younger brother, Rowan, disappeared.

He had gone into the woods to gather berries, something he often did at twilight. But when night fell and Rowan didn’t return, the village was thrown into a panic. The villagers searched the forest, calling his name, but there was no sign of him—only his basket, left abandoned near the edge of the well.

The villagers whispered that the well had claimed him, that the whispers had drawn him in. But Mira refused to believe it. She couldn’t accept that her brother was gone, that the well had somehow taken him. Determined to find him, she made up her mind to go to the well herself, despite the warnings from her family and the villagers.

Armed with a lantern, Mira set out toward the well, her heart pounding with fear and determination. The woods were dark and still, the trees casting long shadows on the forest floor. The air was cool, and the scent of pine filled her lungs as she made her way through the trees. The well loomed ahead, its crumbling stone walls covered in thick moss, the opening dark and foreboding.

“Rowan?” she called, her voice trembling as it echoed through the trees. “Where are you?”

There was no answer, only the soft rustling of leaves in the wind.

As she approached the well, the air grew colder, and a strange, eerie silence settled over the forest. The lantern’s light flickered, casting long shadows on the ground, and the well seemed to pulse with a strange energy. The hairs on the back of Mira’s neck stood on end, but she pressed on, determined to find her brother.

Suddenly, she heard it—a faint, distant voice, echoing up from the depths of the well.

“Mira…”

Her breath caught in her throat. It was Rowan’s voice.

Without hesitation, she ran toward the well, her heart racing in her chest. The ancient stones were cold beneath her hands as she gripped the edge of the well, peering into the darkness below.

“Rowan?” she called again, her voice filled with hope. “I’m here! Where are you?”

The voice came again, closer this time. “Mira… help me…”

She lowered the lantern over the edge of the well, its flickering light casting long, twisting shadows down the stone walls. But there was no bottom, no sign of her brother—only the inky blackness that seemed to stretch forever.

“Rowan?” she whispered, her voice shaking.

And then, slowly, a figure emerged from the darkness below, rising toward her like a shadow from the depths. It was Rowan.

But something was wrong. His face was pale—too pale—and his eyes were wide and blank, like dark, hollow voids. His skin was cold and damp, and his clothes were torn and covered in dirt. He looked like a shadow of the boy she once knew.

“You shouldn’t have come,” he said, his voice low and distant, as though it were coming from somewhere far away.

Mira stumbled back, her heart racing. “What… what happened to you?”

Rowan’s expression twisted with sorrow. “The well,” he whispered. “It’s alive.”

Before Mira could respond, the ground beneath her began to tremble. The air grew colder, and the shadows around the well seemed to come alive, swirling and twisting like smoke. A low, eerie sound filled the air, and Mira’s heart pounded in her chest as she looked around, her mind racing.

Suddenly, dark figures began to emerge from the well—pale, ghostly shapes that flickered in and out of existence, their faces twisted with sorrow and anger. They moved silently, their hollow eyes fixed on Mira, and their skeletal hands reached out toward her.

“The well has taken me,” Rowan whispered. “And now it will take you.”

Tears filled Mira’s eyes as she backed away, her heart breaking. She couldn’t leave Rowan, but she couldn’t stay either. The well was alive, and it was hungry.

“Run,” Rowan whispered, his voice trembling. “You have to go. Now.”

With a final, desperate look at her brother, Mira turned and fled, her feet slipping on the damp earth as she raced through the darkened woods. The ghostly figures howled behind her, their voices echoing through the trees, but she didn’t look back. She ran until she reached the safety of the village, gasping for breath.

When Mira finally reached the edge of the forest, the Forgotten Well was silent once more, its dark depths hidden in the shadows of the night.

But Mira knew the truth. The well had claimed Rowan, just as it had claimed others before him. And though she had escaped, she knew the Forgotten Well wasn’t done.

It was waiting, patient and eternal, for the next soul to wander too close.
